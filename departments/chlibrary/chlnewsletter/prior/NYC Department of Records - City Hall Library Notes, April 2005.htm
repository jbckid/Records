      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_baby.jpg" width="259" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">What were the number one names for baby boys and girls in 1898 and 2001?*
        The answer to this can be found in <i>Summary of Vital Statistics</i>, issued
        yearly by the Health Department. This publication can answer questions
        on birth rates, leading causes of death, marriage rates and many others
        of interest to the serious researcher or even the trivia buff. </p>
      <p>This is one of many resources in the City Hall Library collection published
        by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. In honor of the bicentennial
        of the Board of Health, here is a sampling of some resources available
        from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Board of Health.</p>
      <p>From 1942 to 1981, the Department of Health, published <i>Vital Statistics
        by Health Areas and Health Center Districts</i>. These compilations are a
        valuable source of historical statistical data. They offer a view of
        health conditions in various neighborhoods across the city.</p>
      <p><i>The Manual of the Board of Health</i> published from 1869 to 1874 contains
        the rules and procedures of the Board, including the Sanitary Code. Annual
        reports of the Board of Health and the Dept. of Health provide valuable
        information on programs, statistics and events of the last two centuries.
        Learn more about the smallpox epidemic of 1947, the health of children,
        the influenza epidemic of 1918, and the development of the city&#8217;s
        public health system.</p>
      <p>Starting in 1876, the <i>Sanitary Code</i> was published separately until the
        present-day <i>Health Code</i> was established in 1959. The City Hall Library
        collection includes copies of these original <i>Sanitary Codes</i> and <i>Health
        Codes</i> for anyone interested in health regulations and how policies changed
        over the years. Since 1990, the <i>Health Code</i> is published as <i>Title
        24</i>        of the <i>Rules of the City of New York</i>.</p>
      <p>Another book of interest is <i>New York City&#8217;s Baby Book</i>. Issued
        periodically from 1947 to 1964, this handbook for parents offers guidance
        on dealing with hiccups, tantrums, learning to walk and playing with
        other children, complete with illustrations. <i>Keep Well Leaflets</i> published
        in the 1920&#8217;s were intended for the health-conscious consumer.
        They provide tips on weight loss, taking care of colds, hair care and
        other topics. It seems that some concerns are timeless.</p>
      <p>The Public Health vertical files provide a fascinating array of current
        and historical articles, pamphlets and other materials on topics such
        as municipal hospitals, nursing, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and more. Biographical
        files contain articles on Department of Health Commissioners and others
        of interest. </p>
      <p>More recent publications are available online at the Department of Records
        website, www.nyc.gov/html/records. Also, the Department of Health and
        Mental Hygiene website can be found at www.nyc.gov/health for those interested
        in further information on this agency.</p>
      <p>*Incidentally, the top name for baby girls in 1898 was Mary, for boys
        John. In 2001, Ashley was the favorite for baby girls and Michael for
        boys.<br>
