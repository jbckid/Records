      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: GLOBAL WARMING</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_aug2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Climate
        change, particularly global warming, presents long-term implications
        and challenges. Population, environment and infrastructure will be impacted.
        This article features some resources in the City Hall Library collection
        on climate change, global warming and environmental concerns.</p>
      <p><i>Fire and Ice: How Garbage Incineration Contributes to Global Warming</i>        was published by the Comptroller's Office in 1992. This report
        examines the adverse effects of global warming and conventional methods
        of waste management on the New York City environment. Alternative solutions
        are presented such as recycling and composting. Recommendations for implementing
        cost-effective waste management plans are discussed.</p>
      <p><i>PlaNYC: a Greener, Greater New York</i> was presented by the Mayor's
        Office in 2007. The follow-up publications <i>PlaNYC Progress Report</i> appeared
        in 2008 and 2009. These publications present detailed plans for improving
        the infrastructure and natural environment of New York. Among the topics
        covered are land use, water quality and supply and creating a more efficient
        and safe energy network. Plans for reducing global warming gas emissions
        are presented along with recommendations for maintaining and upgrading
        air quality. The later publications discuss progress in implementing
        <i>PlaNYC</i> and add future plans and objectives.</p>
      <p><i>The New York City Global Warming Survey</i> was conducted by the Center
        for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University and two
        other organizations. Results of a survey of 1000 adults living in New
        York City are presented in this survey. Participants were questioned
        about views on global warming, possible adverse events caused by global
        warming, support for PlaNYC and other initiatives and their own plans
        for conserving energy and the environment.</p>
      <p>In May 2008, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Climate
        Change Program issued its first report. <i>Assessment and Action Plan</i> outlines
        the DEP's program for dealing with global warming, climate change
        and gas emissions. Various problems and strategies are discussed. </p>
      <p>Vertical files on topics such as environment, water supply and pollution
        may also be useful to the researcher.</p>
