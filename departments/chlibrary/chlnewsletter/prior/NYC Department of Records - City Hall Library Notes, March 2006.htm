    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK CITY WOMEN'S HISTORY</b></p>
      <p>
        The U.S. Congress designated March as Women's History Month in
        1978. In honor of this occasion, here are short profiles of two women
        who contributed much to New York City and beyond.</p>
      <p>Leona Baumgartner was appointed Commissioner of the Department of Health
        in 1954, the first woman to serve in this position. Born in Chicago around
        1903, she attended medical school at Yale University. Baumgartner joined
        the New York City Health Department in 1937. Among her accomplishments
        were revising the city's Health Code, promoting the Salk polio
        vaccine and getting the city's water supply fluoridated for better
        dental health. Dr. Baumgartner also served as head of the Office of Human
        Resources and Development in the Foreign Aid Agency during the term of
        President John F. Kennedy. She published numerous articles in periodicals
        varying from McCall's to Public Health Reports and died in 1991.
        Further biographical information such as clippings, reprints of some
        of her articles and reports issued during her tenure at the Department
        of Health can be found in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p>Constance Baker Motley was an African-American lawyer who worked on
        such pioneering civil rights cases as Brown v. Board of Education, which
        ended school segregation by race in 1954. Judge Motley served as a New
        York State Senator from 1964 to 1965. In 1965, she became the first woman
        to be elected Manhattan Borough President. Judge Motley achieved another
        milestone in 1966. She was the first African-American woman to be appointed
        to a federal judgeship. Her autobiography Equal Justice Under Law recounts
        her life story, groundbreaking work in the civil rights movement and
        her experiences as a federal judge. Judge Motley passed away in September
        2005. Further information can be located in the biographical clippings
        files in the City Hall Library.</p>

        York City life and history by exploring the diverse resources available
