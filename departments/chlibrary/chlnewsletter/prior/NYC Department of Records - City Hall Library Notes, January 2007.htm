    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: COURTS AND COURTHOUSES</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jan2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Law
        courts have been part of the New York City government since the days
        of New Amsterdam. Many of the courthouses in the city are recognized
        as examples of outstanding architectural achievement and some have been
        landmarked. This article highlights publications on courthouses and city
        courts that can be found in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>The Architecture of Public Justice: Historic Courthouses in the City
        of New York</i>, written by Mary B. Dierickx and published in 1993 by the
        Department of General Services, describes forty-six buildings. Many of
        them have been designated as landmarks. Details include original use,
        history, location, architecture, significance to the local community
        and more.</p>
      <p>The Surrogate's Court Building located at 31 Chambers Street is
        the home of the City Hall Library and its parent agency, the Department
        of Records and Information Services. <i>Surrogate's Court/Hall of
        Records: a Public Treasure</i>, written by Mary B. Dierickx and published
        by the Department of General Services in 1991, presents a history of
        this unique building. Included are drawings and photographs that enhance
        the text. Learn about the history and design of the building as well
        as the backgrounds of the architects and artists involved. </p>
      <p><i>Courthouse</i> is a chronicle by Paul Hoffman of ninety-nine days spent
        at the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building. Hoffman's book is written
        as a journal and describes each day's events. He witnessed various
        trials, got to know judges, attorneys, reporters and courthouse staff
        and immersed himself in the daily life of the Criminal Court.</p>
      <p><i>Tribunes of the People: the Past and Future of the Magistrates' Courts</i>        by Raymond Moley, published in 1932, is a study of the Magistrates' Courts
        These courts, in existence from 1895 to 1962, handled criminal matters,
        ranging from misdemeanors to felonies like homicide. Moley studies the
        structure of the various courts, defending and prosecuting attorneys,
        the different magistrates, relations of the Magistrates' Courts
        to other courts and what was done to try to improve the system. In 1962,
        the Magistrates' Courts became part of the unified Criminal Court
        system.</p>
      <p>Be sure to consult <i>Annual Reports</i> for courts such as the Magistrates'
        Courts, Children's Court, Court of Special Sessions and Criminal Court
        among others. These publications contain statistics on cases and their
        dispositions, listings of judges, summary of activities for courts and
        their bureaus. Dates range from the late nineteenth to late twentieth
        century, depending on how long the particular court existed.</p>
      <p>Vertical files on courts and courthouses also offer newspaper clippings,
        photos and other material of interest.<br>
