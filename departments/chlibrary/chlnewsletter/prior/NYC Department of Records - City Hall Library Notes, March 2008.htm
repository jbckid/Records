    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_mar2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March as Women's History
        Month. The City Hall Library contains a diverse collection of resources
        on women who have played significant roles in New York City politics,
        history and culture.</p>
      <p><i>My Fight for Birth Control</i> was written by Margaret Sanger and published
        in 1931. Working as a nurse on the Lower East Side, Sanger observed the
        plight of women suffering physically and mentally because of unwanted
        pregnancies. She established the first contraceptive clinic in New York
        and despite arrest and prosecution, continued to advocate for contraceptive
        freedom. Sanger's autobiography describes her pioneering work and
        her life. She was born in 1879 and died in 1966.</p>
      <p><i>Women-Owned Businesses in New York City: Results of the First Survey
          of a Growing Economic Force</i> was published in 2001. This study was
          prepared by the New York City Comptroller's Women's Economic Development
        Task Force and the New York Women's Agenda Economic Development
        Committee. Women business owners in New York City were surveyed about
        pertinent issues. Recommendations are given for developing government
        programs to support women-owned businesses.</p>
      <p><i>Abby Aldrich Rockefeller</i> by Mary Ellen Chase tells the story of the
        matriarch of the Rockefeller family and patron of the arts. Abby Aldrich
        was born in 1874 and married John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1901. As well
        as being the mother of Governor Nelson D. Rockefeller, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
        was instrumental in establishing the Museum of Modern Art and supporting
        American artists and artisans. She died in 1948.</p>
      <p>Publications of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women
        may also be of interest to the researcher. This agency is now known as
        the New York City Commission on Women's Issues.</p>
      <p>Additionally, vertical and biographical files provide a wealth of information
        on the unique contributions of women to New York City life.<br>
