      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: BLACK HISTORY MONTH</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2009.jpg" width="199" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="10" border="1" align="left">February
        has been designated Black History Month in celebration of African-American
        culture and achievements. This article will present some materials focusing
        on Black history that can be found in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>The Mayor's Commission on Black New Yorkers</i> was established by
        Mayor Koch in January 1986 and completed their study in November 1988.
        The Commission found that black New Yorkers tended to be less educated
        and more economically disadvantaged than whites. This report offers possible
        solutions and also contains useful statistical information on education,
        economic development, poverty and employment.</p>
      <p><i>The Harlem Riot of 1943</i> by Dominic Capeci, Jr. studies the causes and
        background of the riot that erupted in the predominantly African-American
        neighborhood in August 1943. Issues examined include the roles of key
        political figures, race relations between blacks and whites in the city,
        particularly Harlem and the black response to the outbreak of World War
        II. The events of the riot, police and public responses and historical
        perspectives are also considered.</p>
      <p><i>Root and Branch: African-Americans in New York and East Jersey: 1613-1863</i>        by Graham Hodges offers a history of blacks during this time in period
        in both New York City and nearby environs, tracing the rise of slavery,
        gradual emancipation and stressing the importance of religion and culture
        to the community. <i>A Covenant with Color: Race and Social Power in
        Brooklyn</i>        by Craig Steven Wilder analyzes racial and social structure in Brooklyn
        from 1636 to 1990. The focus is on relationships between blacks and whites
        and the African- American struggle to be accepted as equal.</p>
      <p>Vertical files can be consulted for further information on topics pertaining
        to black history. Biographical files offer articles and other clippings
        on African-Americans who have contributed to New York City politics,
        culture and life.</p>
