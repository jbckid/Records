    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON: THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS</b>
      <p><img src="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_livingston.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Public schools in New York City re-open in early September. In honor
        of the occasion, here are some publications about schools available in
        the City Hall Library collection. Please note that the topic is quite
        comprehensive. This article presents a small sampling of historical and
        statistical materials</p>
      <p>The Board of Education was established in 1842. <i>Manual of the Board
        of Education</i> provides the regulations, by-laws and standards of the Board.
        Curricula for various grade levels are included here as well as rules
        on the appointment of teachers, expenditures and more. The collection
        includes the years 1842 to 1967. <i>Official Directory</i> offers a wealth of
        historical information on schools in the five boroughs, school boards
        and agency officials for the time span of 1872 to 1995.</p>
      <p>From 1898 to 1995, the Superintendent of Schools issued an <i>Annual
          Report</i>.
        Often published in two parts, the reports provide useful data on enrollment,
        sizes of classes, attendance, promotions, school activities, personnel
        and more. </p>
      <p><i>Class of 2000 Four-Year Longitudinal Report and 1999-00 Event Dropout
          Rates</i>        compiled by the Division of Assessment and
          Accountability at the Board of Education, tracks completion and dropout
          rates for
          high school students
        entering in 1996 and due to graduate in 2000. Statistical table offer
        data on class of 2000 status by year, types of diplomas earned, comparison
        of dropout rates for the last four years and similar figures. Information
        is analyzed and discussed and recommendations for improvement are given.<img src="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_tales.jpg" width="200" height="303" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
      <p>Division of Assessment and Accountability at the renamed Department
        of Education publishes a yearly report ranking schools by achievement
        in language arts. The 2003 <i>Ranking of Elementary and Middle Schools
        by English Language Arts Achievement with Similar School Achievement</i> contains
        rankings based on results of New York City and State English Language
        Arts tests. Results are offered by district and by type of school such
        as elementary or middle. An explanation of statistical methods and findings
        is provided.</p>
      <p><i>110 Livingston Street Revisited: Decentralization in Action</i> by
        David Rogers and Norman H. Chung examines the effects of school decentralization
        in New York City. This policy took effect in 1970. Various school districts
        were studied and interviews with parents, teachers, officials and others
        were conducted by the authors to assess and understand the various issues
        involved. <i>Tales Out of School</i>   by Joseph A. Fernandez and John Underwood
        describes how Fernandez, Chancellor of the New York City schools from
        1990 to1993, planned to reform and rebuild the system. Fernandez&#8217;s
        background and experiences are presented here. In addition, he outlines
        and explains some of his proposed programs such as school-based management
        and satellite schools.</p>
      <p>Vertical files offer clippings, booklets, press releases and other resources
        on such topics as school administration, integration, courses of study,
        dropouts, testing and others.  Find out more about the unique and varied
        history of education in New York City.<br>
