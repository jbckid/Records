      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: FILM, TELEVISION, RADIO</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_aug2008a.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Many
        motion pictures and television shows have used New York City as a setting,
        often filming or taping right on location in the city. This article highlights
        some resources on movies, television and radio that can be found in the
        City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Film and Television Production in New York City: Beyond the Glitz:
          Lights, Cameras Jobs</i> was prepared by Cristina C. Ampil for the
          New York City Economic Policy and Marketing Group. This publication
          studies the state
        of the motion picture industry in New York in the early 1990s,
        reviews opportunities for growth with cable television and digital technologies
        and proposes some strategies to promote and enhance film production in
        the city. </p>
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_aug2008b.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></i>In 1968, the Mayor&#8217;s Advisory Task Force on CATV and Telecommunications
        issued <i>A Report on Cable Television and Cable Telecommunications in
        New York City</i>. Established in 1967, the Task Force explored various issues
        and concerns regarding telecommunications and television systems. This
        report discusses cable technology at the time, the existing operations
        in New York City, the role of the federal government and offers recommendations
        for the future.</p>
      <p><i>WNYC</i> is a booklet published in 1984 by the Municipal Broadcast
        System to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of its radio and television
        stations.
        History of both the municipal radio and television stations is presented
        along with photographs of performers, personnel and facilities. The radio
        station WNYC was sold to the WNYC Foundation in 1997. </p>
      <p><i>The Entertainment Arts Industry in New York: Part 3: The Film and
          Video Industry - a Profile</i> was published in 1997 by Exploring the
          Metropolis, Inc. A profile of the industry is presented along with
          statistical data,
        discussion of the workings of film production, sources of financing,
        advantages and disadvantages to working in New York City and recommendations.</p>
      <p>Program guides for the municipal radio and television stations may be
        of interest to the researcher. <i>Masterwork Bulletin</i>, a program guide for
        WNYC radio, is kept in the collection. Holdings are from 1935 to 1975.
        Explore the resources mentioned here and others in the vertical files
        to find out more about motion pictures, television and radio in New York
        City.</p>
