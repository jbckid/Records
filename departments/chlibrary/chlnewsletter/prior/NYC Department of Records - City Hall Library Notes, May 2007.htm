    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NEWSPAPER  HISTORY</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_may2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">According
        to the <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>, the first New York City newspaper
        was published in 1725. Since then, the newspaper has been a staple of
        New York life in print and more recently in electronic format. This article
        highlights some publications on newspapers and the newspaper business
        in New York City.</p>
      <p><i>Tell it to Sweeney: an Informal History of the Daily News</i> by John Chapman
        was published in 1961. This book tells the story of the establishment
        of the <i>Daily News</i> as a paper for the average working person. Emphasizing
        photos, features such as "Voice of the People," and sensationalistic
        headlines and reporting, the News became a success in the 1920's. "Tell
        it to Sweeney" was an early advertising slogan of the newspaper,
        referring to the average New Yorker as opposed to the wealthy.</p>
      <p><i>The Eagle and Brooklyn: a Community Newspaper, 1841-1955</i> by Raymond
        A. Schroth is a history of the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i> newspaper. Founded in 1841,
        the paper became influential locally and nationally. This book charts
        the paper's rise as Brooklyn developed. The Eagle encouraged economic
        and social expansion in Brooklyn and served as a voice for the community.
        It also became involved in political reform on the national level. As
        the population and social climate of Brooklyn changed, the paper gradually
        became less popular and eventually ceased operations after a prolonged
        labor dispute.</p>
      <p><i>When Giants Ruled: the Story of Park Row, New York's Great Newspaper
        Street</i> by Hy B. Turner chronicles the development of Park Row as the
        center of newspaper publishing in the nineteenth and early twentieth
        centuries. Beginning with the establishment of the <i>New York Sun</i> and the
        growth of rival papers, Park Row became known as "Newspaper Row." The
        author discusses the careers and accomplishments of such editors and
        publishers as Horace Greeley, Joseph Pulitzer, Adolph S. Ochs and William
        Randolph Hearst. Also described is the work of writers and illustrators,
        competition for circulation, the role of newspapers in the political
        process and factors that led to the decline of Park Row as a newspaper
        center.</p>
      <p><i>Pulitzer</i> by W. A. Swanberg is a biography of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher
        of the New York World from 1883 to 1911. A Hungarian immigrant from a
        poor family, Pulitzer first made his fortune in newspaper publishing
        in St. Louis then New York. The World became an important newspaper under
        Pulitzer's leadership, famous for excellent reporting and courageous
        editorial stances. </p>
