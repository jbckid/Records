    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_mar2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March as Women's History
        Month. The City Hall Library contains a diverse collection of resources
        on women who have played significant roles in New York City politics,
        history and culture.</p>
      <p><i>Belle Moskowitz: Feminine Politics & the Exercise of Power in the
        Age of Alfred E. Smith</i> by Elisabeth Israels Perry profiles the woman
        who served as New York State Governor Alfred E. Smith's strategist
        and campaign manager. Born in East Harlem to immigrant parents, Moskowitz
        was active as a social worker and reformer in the early twentieth century.
        Through her work as a member of women's political organizations,
        she met Alfred E. Smith, organized his campaign to appeal to women voters
        and became his chief public relations person. Belle Moskowitz died in
        1933 at the age of fifty-five.</p>
      <p><i>Emma Lazarus: Woman with a Torch</i> by Eve Merriam is the story of the
        woman who wrote the poem inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty.
        Part of a middle-class Jewish family in New York City, Lazarus displayed
        an early talent for writing and languages. Through her poetry, articles
        and other writing, she became a spokesperson and advocate, for immigrants
        and poor people. Lazarus died in 1887 at the age of thirty-eight.</p>
      <p><i>Detective Marie Cirile: Memoirs of a Police Officer</i> by Marie
        Cirile describes the experiences of a police officer from the 1950's
        to
        the 1970's. During a time when        "policewomen"  were
        not given many opportunities for advancement, Cirile became a pioneer
        as one of the first to work on the NYPD Burglary
        Squad. This book details some of her adventures and the frustrations
        encountered and offers Cirile's ideas for change in the Police
        Department.      </p>
      <p><i>Battle to Succeed: Challenges and Obstacles Faced by NYC Women</i> is
        a report from the New York City Public Advocate published in 2003. This
        publication outlines some key issues such as lack of education, low median
        income and health problems that women may face in trying to improve
        their lives. Statistics are given as well.</p>
      <p>Researchers may also refer to the City Hall Library's vertical
        and biographical files for a wealth of information on the unique contributions
        of women to New York City life.      </p>
