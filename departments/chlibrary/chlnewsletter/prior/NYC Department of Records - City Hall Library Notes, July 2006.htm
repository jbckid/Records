    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: MUSIC IN  NEW YORK CITY</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jazz.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New
        York City is famous as a center for music of all kinds. Anything from
        opera to rock to hip-hop can be found here. The city has also been the
        subject or setting of numerous songs. This article gives a sample of
        what can be found in the City Hall Library collection on the topics of
        music and musicians.</p>
      <p><i>The New York City Opera: an American Adventure with the Complete
          Annals</i>        by Martin L. Skolt, chronicles the history of the opera company from
        its beginnings in 1944 to 1981. Included are a history of opera, the
        development of City Opera, struggles to survive and the move from City
        Center to the New York State Theatre at Lincoln Center. Cast lists for
        all performances up until 1981, as well as lists of recordings and radio
        broadcasts are given. </p>
      <p><i>Philharmonic: A History of New York's Orchestra</i> by Howard Shanet
        presents the story of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra from 1842 to
        the early 1970's. Conductors of the orchestra have included Gustav
        Mahler, Leopold Stokowski and Leonard Bernstein. The book explores the
        history of orchestras in New York before 1842, development of the Philharmonic,
        struggles and reorganization in the early and mid-twentieth century,
        the Leonard Bernstein years and the future. An appendix lists all concerts
        and musical repertoire from 1842 to 1971.</p>
      <p><i>Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York</i>        by Susie J. Tanenbaum explores the history of subway music, official
        (actually promoting the subway system) and "freelance", which
        involves independent musicians performing their own style of music. Tanenbaum
        profiles various musicians who play in the subway, their motivations
        for doing so and the cultural implications. Also described is the program
        Music Under New York, administered by the MTA Arts for Transit, which
        allows certain musicians to perform in the subway with MTA support. The
        relationship between performers and law enforcement is discussed as well.</p>
      <p><i>Gigs: Jazz and the Cabaret Laws in New York City</i> by Paul Chevigny takes
        a look at the system of licensing and regulation of entertainment that
        went into effect in 1926 and was not repealed until 1986. Musicians were
        subject to strict licensing requirements in order to be able to play
        in cabarets. Venues also were severely regulated. The book explores the
        history of cabaret regulation, effects on musicians, changing social
        and cultural mores and attitudes and the litigation that finally resulted
        in the termination of this regulatory system. The City Hall Library has
        a copy of the Regulations Governing Cabarets, Catering Establishments,
        Public Dance Halls, Public Dances or Balls and Masquerade or Fancy Dress
        Dances or Balls issued by the Police Department circa 1955.</p>
      <p>Some fascinating material is contained in the vertical files. The file
        on music includes original sheet music for the song "New York Town" by
        John Golden and Harold Orlob, published in 1953 and costing 50 cents.
        The song was dedicated to New York City on its 300th anniversary and
        to Robert F. Wagner, Jr, then the Mayor. A list of songs about New York
        City, compiled by staff at New York Public Library in 1948, features
        well-known items like "Forty-Second Street" and less famous
        numbers like "Moon Over Brooklyn." Articles from the 1930's
        to the present can be found in the vertical files, too.
