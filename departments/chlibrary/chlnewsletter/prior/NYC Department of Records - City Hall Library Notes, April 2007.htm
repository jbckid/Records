	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_apr2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New
        York has always been known as a city that welcomed immigrants. Individuals
        and groups arriving from all over the world have contributed to the diversity
        and richness of New York City life and culture. In honor of Immigrant
        History Week, April 16 to April 22, 2007, this article will highlight
        some resources on this topic in the City Hall Library collection. </p>
      <p><i>A Time to Remember</i> by Marie Jastrow is a memoir of the author's
        childhood and adolescence. Her family arrived in the United States from
        Serbia in 1905 and settled in New York City. Jastrow tells of the poverty
        and the struggles to adapt to a new land. She also remembers how the
        women in her family carved out new roles as leaders and breadwinners. </p>
      <p><i>The Ellis Island Immigrant Cookbook</i> by Tom Bernardin is a compilation
        of recipes from immigrants and their descendants. Recipes are listed
        by country of origin. Learn how to make Italian stuffed eggplant, Danish
        apple cake, Jamaican oxtail stew and other dishes. Also included is background
        information on Ellis Island, plus advice on compiling and preserving
        family recipes and tracing genealogy. </p>
      <p><i>Quarantine!: East European Jewish Immigrants and the New York City
          Epidemics of 1892</i> by Howard Markel tells the story of the typhus and cholera epidemics
        that paralyzed the city in 1892. The typhus fever apparently originated
        on a ship transporting East European Jewish immigrants to New York. The
        book chronicles the experiences of the immigrants who were quarantined.
        Also included are discussions of diagnosis and treatment of the ill,
        actions taken by legislators and how newspapers reported on the issues
        involved.</p>
      <p>City agency publications include <i>The Newest New Yorkers</i> from the Department
        of City Planning, published in a series of reports covering the 1980's
        to 2000. Statistics on demographics and analysis of the data are presented.
        This report provides comprehensive and helpful information for anyone
        researching recent immigration trends.</p>
      <p>Vertical and biographical files are other sources of information for
        the researcher on the continuing contribution of immigrants to New York
        City life.
