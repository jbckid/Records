    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK CITY MAYORS</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_sethlow.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">In
        November 2005, New York City voters elected the next Mayor. To mark the
        occasion, this article will present a sample of resources on some of
        the lesser-known Mayors of this city.</p>
      
     

      <p>Fernando Wood was Mayor from 1855 to 1858 and again from 1860 to 1862,
        <i>Fernando Wood of New York</i> by Samuel A. Pleasants recounts the
        story of Wood&#8217;s beginnings as a Tammany Hall politician, originally
        serving in the United States Congress. As Mayor, he attempted to reorganize
        the
        Police Department and came into conflict with the state legislature in
        Albany over this and other issues. Re-elected in 1860 and notorious as
        a supporter of slavery in the early days of the Civil War, Wood finished
        his career with a return to Congress.<img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_elegant.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
      <p>Oakey Hall served as Mayor from 1869 to 1872. <i>The Elegant Oakey</i> by Croswell
        Bowen describes Hall&#8217;s career in politics and his association with
        Boss Tweed. After serving as New York County District Attorney, Hall
        was elected Mayor and became known for his excellent fashion sense. Accused
        of being a member of the infamous Tweed Ring, Hall stood trial three
        times for neglect of duty as Mayor and was eventually acquitted. </p>
      <p><i>Seth Low: The Reformer in an Urban and Industrial Age</i> by Gerald
        Kurland profiles the man who was Mayor from 1902 to 1903. Mayor of Brooklyn
        when
        it was a separate city; Low became known as a reformer, overhauling the
        tax structure, school system and awarding of franchises there. After
        serving as President of Columbia University, Low took office as Mayor
        of New York in 1902. He continued his work as a reformer, reorganizing
        the Police Department, improving services to city residents and supporting
        the working class. After his mayoral term ended, Low worked as a labor
        mediator and served as president of the New York State Chamber of Commerce
        among other accomplishments.</p>
      <p><i>The Gentleman and the Tiger: the Autobiography of George B. McClellan,
        Jr</i>. edited by Harold C. Syrett is the story of the Mayor of New York
        City from 1904 to 1909. Son of a famous Civil War general, McClellan
        writes about the influence of his father on his life, his work as a newspaper
        reporter and his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Brooklyn
        Bridge in 1889. This job started McClellan&#8217;s political career.
        Serving two terms as Mayor, he eventually feuded with the Tammany Hall
        political boss who assisted in his rise to political power. McClellan
        was interested in the design of public buildings and strongly supported
        the Municipal Arts Commission. In 1911, McClellan became a professor
        at Princeton University and after retirement in 1931, relocated to Washington,
        D.C., remaining there until his death.</p>
      <p>William J. Gaynor, Mayor from 1910 to 1913, is profiled in <i>William
          Jay Gaynor: Mayor of New York</i> by Mortimer Smith. Prior to election, Gaynor
        served as a New York State Supreme Court judge. Gaynor became famous
        for his irascible personality and extensive knowledge of philosophy and
        religion. He successfully appointed city officials on the basis of their
        ability rather than Tammany Hall connections and enacted governmental
        reforms. In 1910, Gaynor was shot in the throat by a would-be assassin.
        He never quite recovered and died while on an ocean voyage to England.</p>
      <p><i>John Purroy Mitchel: the Boy Mayor of New York</i> by Edwin R. Lewinson
        recounts the life of the man who was Mayor from 1913 to 1917. At thirty-four,
        Mitchel was the youngest person ever to be elected Mayor; thus the moniker
        of &#8220;Boy Mayor.&#8221; Mitchel reformed the municipal government
        system, including the coroner&#8217;s office, the Police Department,
        Comptroller&#8217;s office among others. He also tried to help the unemployed
        and the labor unions. Unhappily, Mitchel&#8217;s programs and ideas were
        not completely successful and he alienated many voters. After defeat
        in the 1917 election, Mitchel enlisted in the Air Corps to train as a
        pilot and serve in World War I. He died in an airplane accident.</p>
