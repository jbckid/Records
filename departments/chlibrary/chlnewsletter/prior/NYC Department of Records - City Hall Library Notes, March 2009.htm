      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: WOMEN AND IRISH-AMERICANS</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p>Since
        1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March as Women's History
        Month. The month of March also brings St. Patrick's Day, a celebration
        of all things Irish. In honor of both events, this article features some
        resources in the City Hall Library on the contributions and achievements
        of women and Irish-Americans to New York City life.</p>
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_mar2009.jpg" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="10" border="1" align="left">The First Hurrah: a Biography of Alfred E. Smith</i> by Richard O'Connor
        chronicles the life of the Irish-American politician and the first Roman
        Catholic Presidential candidate. Smith grew up on the Lower East Side
        of New York City and became part of the Tammany Hall organization that
        governed New York City politics. Smith served four terms as governor
        of New York State and worked for reforms to improve conditions for the
        average citizen. After a bitter defeat in the 1928 Presidential race,
        he served as president of the Empire State Building Company and worked
        at various charitable activities. Smith died in 1944.</p>
      <p><i>The Gentleman from New York</i> is a biography of Daniel Patrick Moynihan
        by Godfrey Hodgson. The book chronicles Moynihan's life from youth
        in New York City and Long Island to his political career. This career
        included two ambassadorships and election to the U.S. Senate representing
        New York State. Moynihan's politics, philosophy and professional
        associations are examined in detail. Daniel Patrick Moynihan passed away
        in 2003.</p>
      <p>The Mayor's Commission on the Status of Women published
        <i>Women Making History: Conversations with Fifteen New Yorkers</i> in
        1985. The book features interviews with fifteen diverse New York women
        including Geraldine Ferraro, Beverly Sills and Charlayne Hunter-Gault.
        The Library
        also has copies of Mayoral Executive Orders 28 of 1975 and 86 of 1987,
        concerning the establishment and functions of the Commission. This agency
        is now known as the Mayor's Commission on Women's Issues.</p>
      <p>Consult the biographical and vertical files for articles and other materials
        on prominent women and Irish-Americans who have contributed to New York
        City history and life. For example, learn more about Elinor Guggenheimer,
        who served as the first female member of the City Planning Commission
        in 1961. From 1974 to 1978, Guggenheimer worked as Commissioner of Consumer
        Affairs and remained active after that, founding several organizations
        to assist women. She died in 2008.<br>

          City. As part of a program to modernize property
          tax appraisals, New York City photographed every house and building
          in the five boroughs between 1939 and 1941, and again in the mid-1980s. Now available exclusively from the Municipal
          Archives, these photographs make a unique gift for friends and family. </p>
