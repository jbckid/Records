      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: HISTORY OF FERRIES</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_aug2009.jpg" width="200" height="299" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>Before
        bridges and tunnels were constructed, New York City depended heavily
        on ferry transportation between the boroughs and New Jersey. By the 1920s,
        commuter ferries were practically nonexistent due to bridge and tunnel
        access. However, the Staten Island Ferry, established in 1816, is still
        a mainstay and ferry routes have enjoyed a revival in recent years as
        an alternative to congested roadways and overcrowded public transportation.
        This article features some resources on ferries that can be found in
        the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Over and Back: the History of Ferryboats in New York Harbor</i> by
        Brian J. Cudahy chronicles the story of ferry transportation in the city
        from
        1812 to the late 1980s. Beginning with the first steamboat ferry
        between New York and New Jersey, here is a history of the growth and
        eventual decline of ferry transportation. Included are photographs and
        illustrations of ferryboats and travel, statistics on general trends
        and performance, municipal takeover of the ferry routes and ferry transportation
        today.</p>
      <p><i>Staten Island Ferry System Study</i> was prepared by the New York City Transportation
        Administration and the Department of Marine and Aviation in 1975. This
        study reviews the conditions at the three Staten Island ferry terminals
        in New York City. Recommendations for rebuilding and improving are given.</p>
      <p><i>Williamsburgh and Its Ferries by</i> Charles Lawesson explores the history
        of ferry service between Williamsburgh in Brooklyn and lower Manhattan.
        Origins of the ferry service, leasing and ownership and railroad connections
        are described. The elimination of the ferry service is also discussed.
        Included are a list of all companies that operated ferries to and from
        Williamsburgh, descriptions of ferryboats in the fleet and various illustrations.</p>
      <p><i>Improving Landside Access for Ferry Services</i> was published by the Department
        of City Planning in 1988. The study examines the possibility of upgrading
        existing ferry sites and adding new ones to help ease congestion in traveling.
        Key issues include landside access to ferry terminal sites, making efficient
        use of all transit services and improving private ferry services. Case
        studies of five sites where ferry service was either offered or could
        be instituted are presented.</p>
      <p>Articles and other clippings in the vertical files may be of interest
        to the researcher. Also, consider exploring publications from Department
        of Docks and Ferries, Department of Marine and Aviation and Department
        of Transportation (DOT). <br>
