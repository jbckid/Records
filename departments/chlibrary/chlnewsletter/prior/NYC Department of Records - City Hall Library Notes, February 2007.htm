    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: BLACK HISTORY MONTH</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">February
        has been designated Black History Month in honor of African-American
        culture and achievements. This article focuses on three African-American
        political figures in New York City.</p>
      <p>Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. was born in 1904. An ordained Baptist minister,
        he was the first African-American elected to the City Council in 1941.
        In 1944, he was elected to the U.S. Congress, where he served until 1968.
        <i>Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.: the Political Biography of an American Dilemma</i>        by Charles V. Hamilton details Powell's often controversial career,
        his work in advancing civil rights and his eventual downfall. <i>Adam
        by Adam</i> is Powell's autobiography published in 1971. Powell recalls
        his career and personal life, providing his own explanation and viewpoints
        of the events that led to his expulsion from Congress in 1967 and re-election
        the following year. He died in 1972.</p>
      <p>J. Raymond Jones, born in 1899 in the Virgin Islands, arrived in New
        York City in 1918. He eventually became the first African-American leader
        of the Manhattan Democratic organization. <i>The Harlem Fox: J. Raymond
        Jones and Tammany, 1920-1970</i> by John C. Walter describes Jones's
        rise to power within the Democratic party and his career as district
        leader, City Council member and party chairperson. Jones went on to encourage
        blacks to become involved in the Democratic party, promoted the careers
        of several successful African-American politicians and worked to fight
        segregation in the ranks of the party. His influence extended to national
        politics. Jones died in 1991.</p>
      <p>Shirley Chisholm, born in 1924, was the first African-American woman
        elected to the U. S. Congress in 1968, representing a district in Brooklyn.
        She also was a candidate for the Presidential nomination in 1972. <i>The
        Good Fight</i> is Chisholm's first-person account of her 1972 campaign.
        Chisholm recounts her experiences on the campaign trail, discusses problems
        and power struggles within the Democratic party and offers recommendations
        for future change. Shirley Chisholm died in 2005.</p>
      <p>Consult the biographical clippings files for information on the lives
        and careers of African-American politicians and officials. The library
        catalogue and vertical files also contain diverse resources on African-American
        history, culture and life in New York City. </p>
