    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: FASHION</b></p>
	<p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dec2006.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New
        York City has established itself as one of the world&#8217;s fashion
        centers. The city is home to designer showrooms, retail outlets and fashion
        publications such as <i>Women&#8217;s Wear Daily</i>. This article highlights
        some publications on fashion and the Garment District.</p>
      <p><i>City of New York Golden Anniversary of Fashion</i> is a commemorative booklet
        published in 1948 by the Mayor&#8217;s Committee for the Commemoration
        of the Golden Anniversary of the City of New York. Featured are a history
        of fashion in New York City, designer and manufacturer advertisements
        and advice on proper dress for men and women. Photographs and sketches
        enhance the text and offer visual perspective on changes in fashion.</p>
      <p><i>Through the Eye of the Needle: Immigrants and Enterprise in New York
        City&#8217;s Garment Trades</i> by Roger D. Waldinger, published in 1989,
        examines the rise of the immigrant entrepreneur in the New York garment
        industry from the end of World War II to the 1980&#8217;s. Areas covered
        include history of the garment industry in the city, growth of firms
        run by immigrants, conditions that permit the rise of such businesses
        and more.</p>
      <p><i>Trends in the New York Clothing Industry</i> by Leonard A. Drake and Carrie
        Glasser was a study undertaken for the Mayor&#8217;s Business Advisory
        Commission in 1942. This report analyzes the garment industry at the
        time, points out problems and provides ideas for future expansion and
        change. Statistics on production, employment and earnings are given for
        New York City and the United States.</p>
      <p><i>New York City Garment Center Study: Program and Zoning Recommendations</i>        was prepared by the Policy Analysis Division of the Office for Economic
        Development, the Department of City Planning and the Public Development
        Corporation in 1986. This study reviews the economic situation in the
        Garment District at the time. Pertinent concerns included the development
        of the commercial real estate market and its effects on the garment center,
        the possibility of loft conversions, environmental issues and competition
        from imports. Recommendations for zoning, assistance to business owners
        and improved services are presented.</p>

        industry and related issues such as economy, fashion and style and the
        Garment District neighborhood.
