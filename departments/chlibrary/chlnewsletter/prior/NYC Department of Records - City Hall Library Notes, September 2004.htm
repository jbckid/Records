    <td>    <strong>SPOTLIGHT ON:  IMMIGRANTS AND NEW YORK CITY
      </strong>
      <p><em><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_immigrant.jpg" alt="Immigrant Life in New York City" width="200" height="307" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"></em>New York City has always been known as a city of immigrants. Starting
      from 1624 with the arrival of the first European settlers to the influx
      of Asians, Latin Americans and Caribbean immigrants, the city is a diverse
      mixture of groups and individuals. Most New Yorkers have roots in another
      country or countries. Other immigrants used New York as an arrival point
      and went on to settle in other areas of the United States. </p>
    <p>The City Hall Library offers many resources on immigrants, immigration
      and various national, racial and religious groups. These are just a small
      example of what the researcher can find in the collection.</p>
    <p><em>Beyond the Melting Pot</em> by Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, published
      in 1963, discusses the history, culture, economics and influence of African-Americans,
      Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish in New York City. <em>From Ellis
      Island to JFK: New York&#8217;s Two Great Waves of Immigration</em> by Nancy Foner
      compares the first major immigration from 1880 to 1920 to the next great
      wave of immigrants in the 1990s. Included are comparisons of countries
      of origin, residential patterns, economic conditions and education in both
      periods.<em> Immigrant Life in New York City: 1825-1863</em> by Robert Ernst studies
      the reasons why so many immigrants came at that time, their working and
      cultural lives in New York City and assimilation. <em>New York: An Illustrated
      History of the People</em> by Allan Schoener, complete with photos, prints,
      drawings and original writings from newspapers and other sources, documents
      the history of immigration, immigrant groups and historical events from
      the days of the sixteenth century explorers to the late twentieth century.</p>
    <p><em><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_newest.jpg" alt="The Newest New Yorkers" width="210" height="265" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Immigrant Women in the Land of Dollars: Life and Culture on the Lower
      East Side, 1890-1925</em> by Elizabeth Ewen tells the story of Jewish and Italian
      women who emigrated to New York, and the next generation, their daughters
      born in the United States. The focus is on women in the workplace and at
      home, how they established new lives, contributed to the economy, dealt
      with sickness and overcrowded living conditions and eventually became part
      of the modern culture. </p>
    <p>City agency publications include <em>The Newest New Yorkers</em> published in a
      series of reports covering the 1980&#8217;s to 1996. Statistics on demographics
      are accompanied by a volume of analysis. Areas covered include places of
      birth of immigrants, demographic, social and economic characteristics,
      settlement patterns and naturalization. This report provides comprehensive
      and helpful information for anyone researching recent immigration trends.</p>
    <p>Vertical files on immigrants, population and various ethnic, racial and
      religious groups offer newspaper clippings and magazine articles on topics
      such as problems of immigrants, economic conditions, social customs and
      population changes. Our biographical files may feature articles on immigrants
      who, through their accomplishments, became prominent in New York City.</p>
    <p>These are just some of the resources accessible to the researcher who
      needs information on immigrants. Find out more about our predecessors who
      built New York City and today&#8217;s immigrants who carry on.<br>

    <p><strong>THE CITY HALL LIBRARY CARD CATALOG</strong></p>    <p>The card catalog was invented by in the 1870&#8217;s by American librarians.
      The first cards were hand written in a special penmanship called &#8220;library
      hand&#8221;. In 1901 the Library of Congress began offering printed sets
      of catalog cards to other libraries for a modest cost.</p>
    <p>The City Hall Library catalog is a composite of many years of different
      librarians&#8217; contributions. The catalog includes - in addition to
      books - maps, articles in journals, pamphlets in files and other specialized
      materials.</p>
    <p>It is a divided catalog in two main sections. One section includes authors
      and titles (84 drawers); the other section is for subject access (85 drawers).
      Serial publications, such as journals or annual reports are listed, although
      details of holdings for more recent years are kept in another file. Ask
      library staff for assistance.<br>
