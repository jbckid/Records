    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: APARTMENT HOUSE HISTORY</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dakota.jpg" width="250" height="372" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">According to the <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>, the first apartment
        building was completed in 1869. Until the 1880&#8217;s, these kinds of
        buildings were often called &#8220;French flats.&#8221; The term &#8220;apartment&#8221; became
        more commonly used by the 1880&#8217;s. Apartment buildings and the living
        quarters within have since become an essential part of the New York City
        lifestyle and scene. Included here are just a few resources on the apartment
        building and apartment living.</p>
      <p><i>New York, New York: How the Apartment House Transformed the Life
          of the City (1860-1930)</i> by Elizabeth Hawes examines how the apartment house
        came into its own during these years and affected the lives of city dwellers.
        Starting with the buildings designed by Richard Morris Hunt, covering
        the development of the Upper West Side and Fifth Avenue, and reviewing
        various architects and their styles, the author offers a social and aesthetic
        history of the apartment house.</p>
      <p><i>Living It Up: A Guide to the Named Apartment Houses of New York</i> by Thomas
        E. Norton and Jerry E. Patterson offers an inventory, in alphabetical
        order, of every apartment house with a name in Manhattan, the address
        of each building and information on the origins of the name. Also featured
        are five suggested walking tours and a short history of the apartment
        building in the city.</p>
      <p><i>Alone Together: A History of New York&#8217;s Early Apartments</i> by Elizabeth
        Collins Cromley offers an architectural history of the apartment building
        from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century. Considered are
        various styles of building, how changing needs of city dwellers influenced
        architectural changes, the function of the apartment building in the
        expanding city and the kinds of tenants who might be living in these
        apartments.</p>
      <p><i>Life at the Dakota</i> by Stephen Birmingham, published in 1979, chronicles
        the history of the famous apartment building located at 72nd Street and
        Central Park West. Designed by Henry Hardenbergh and completed in 1884,
        the Dakota became home to celebrities such as Boris Karloff, Leonard
        Bernstein, Lauren Bacall and the late John Lennon. The book discusses
        how the Dakota came to be built, architectural style, interiors, conversion
        to co-ops and offers anecdotes about daily living and some of the unique
        individuals, famous and otherwise, who lived or worked there.</p>
      <p>          <i>Housing New York City 1999</i>, prepared by Dr. Moon Wha Lee for the New
          York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, published
          in 2002, provides a wealth of statistical information on apartment
            and house rentals, vacancies, income of renters, conditions of housing,
            rental
          expenditures and other issues of concern.</p>
      <p>Vertical files on the topics of apartments and housing may also be of
        interest to the user. </p>
      <p>These are just a few examples of the fascinating material you may find
        at the City Hall Library on apartment houses, a unique and important
        part of city life.<br>
