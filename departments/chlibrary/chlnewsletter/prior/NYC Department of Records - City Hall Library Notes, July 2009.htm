      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW AMSTERDAM</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jul2009.jpg" width="200" height="299" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>September
        3, 2009 will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the
        Dutch East India Company expedition in what is now New York City. This
        expedition, led by Henry Hudson, was the first of several. By 1626, the
        New Amsterdam colony had been established. New Amsterdam remained under
        Dutch control until September 1664 when the British seized the colony
        and it was renamed New York. This article features some resources on
        the Dutch colony and New Amsterdam that can be found in the City Hall
        Library.</p>
      <p><i>The Dutch Founding of New York</i> by Thomas A. Janvier was originally published
        in 1903 and reprinted in 1967. This book chronicles the expeditions of
        the Dutch East India Company, establishment of the first settlements,
        developments in trade and government matters. The British takeover is
        also discussed. Original illustrations and maps enhance the text.</p>
      <p><i>Records of New Amsterdam: 1653 to 1664</i> is a six-volume set. This consists
        of English translations of various records of the Burgomasters and Schepens
        of New Amsterdam. Ordinances, court minutes, administrative minutes and
        more are included. <i>Minutes of the Executive Board of the Burgomasters
        of New Amsterdam</i> deals with various matters brought before this body
        such as debts, care of orphans, fire fighting, etc. All of these publications
        were originally translated and edited by Berthold Fernow, an archivist
        of New York State in 1907. In 1967, the <i>Records</i> were reprinted. A new
        edition of the <i>Minutes of the Executive Board</i> appeared in 1970.</p>
      <p><i>A Sweet and Alien Land: the Story of Dutch New York</i> by Henri and Barbara
        van der Zee was published in 1978. Examined in this book are the difficulties
        faced by Dutch colonists in trading and establishing settlements. Additionally,
        they had to deal with Native American tribes, rivals such as the British
        and lack of regulation by the Dutch East India Company. Unfortunately
        opportunities for greed, exploitation and scheming were rife. The good
        and bad of the Dutch experience are chronicled here ending with the final
        surrender to the British.<br>
