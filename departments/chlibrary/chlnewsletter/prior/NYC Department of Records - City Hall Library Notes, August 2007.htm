    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NURSES AND NURSING IN NEW YORK CITY</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_aug2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Training
        of nurses in New York City began in 1798. By 1857, Elizabeth Blackwell,
        the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States, had established
        a formal program of instruction at the New York Infirmary for Women and
        Children, according to the <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>. Since those
        days, medical care and the nursing profession have greatly advanced.
        This article considers some publications in the City Hall Library on
        nurses and the nursing profession. </p>
      <p><i>Nursing . . . a Growing Profession</i> was published by the Department
        of Hospitals in 1947. This booklet describes the programs for nurses'
        training
        in New York City municipal hospitals. Photographs offer glimpses of nursing
        students and professionals at work. </p>
      <p><i>A Study of the Nursing Service in the Department of Hospitals of
          the City of New York</i> was prepared by the Bureau of the Budget in 1949. Future
        Mayor Abraham Beame was Assistant Director of the Budget at the time.
        This report examines the nursing shortage in city hospitals, general
        tasks nurses performed and working conditions. Recommendations are made
        for recruitment of students and retaining nursing staff. Statistics on
        salaries, number of personnel, hours of work, patients and other indicators
        are offered.</p>
      <p><i>Help Wanted: Recruiting and Retaining Nurses at New York City's
        Health and Hospitals Corporation</i> by INTERFACE, studies the nursing
        shortage at municipal hospitals in the early 1990's and offers possible
        solutions. Included are examination of the problem at Health and Hospitals
        Corporation (HHC) hospitals, how other hospitals in the city have dealt
        with this and a survey of programs across the country. A work satisfaction
        survey of HHC nurses is discussed and recommendations are given for improving
        working conditions, attracting new recruits and restructuring nursing
        administration. Statistics are provided on number of nurses per patient,
        occupancy rates at HHC hospitals, salaries, etc.</p>
      <p><i>Adding Insult to Injury: No School Nurse Available</i> prepared by the City
        Council in 2004 discusses the shortage of nurses on staff in New York
        City public schools. Major findings of the study are provided along with
        recommendations for improving and extending nursing services in the schools.</p>
      <p>Explore further resources in the City Hall Library collection such as
        publications from nursing schools at the municipal hospitals, vertical
        files and more. Current city agency publications on health can be accessed
        at <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/govpub/healt1.shtml">http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/govpub/healt1.shtml</a>.
