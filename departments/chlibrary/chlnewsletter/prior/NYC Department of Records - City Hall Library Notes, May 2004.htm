      COLLECTION SPOTLIGHT: BIOGRAPHICAL CLIPPINGS COLLECTION</strong></p>
    <p>Do you want to learn something about the first woman candidate for a borough
      presidency? (Dorothy Bell Lawrence, Republican, Manhattan, 1961). What
      was Michael Quill best known for? (Leadership of the Transport Workers
      Union during the 1966 transit strike). When did Fiorello LaGuardia&#8217;s
      wife die? (September 22, 1989). The City Hall Library&#8217;s collection
      of biographical clippings holds the answers to such questions. Over 150
      binders feature newspaper and magazine articles, press releases and other
      writings on the famous and obscure. Consult the biographical files for
      career information, personal and educational background, accomplishments
      and disasters in the lives of New York City politicians and others.</p>
    <p>Clippings are arranged alphabetically by last name. Material on mayors
      and other major figures, such as Robert Moses, are kept separately from
      the other binders. Time and again, this has proven to be an important information
      trove for researchers, city employees, students and others. Please feel
      free to come in and ask the staff for assistance in using this valuable
      source.
