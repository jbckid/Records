	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jan2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">The
        Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum are
        just three of the many located in New York City. In all five boroughs
        you will find a rich assortment of museums for all interests. Here is
        a sample of publications in the City Hall Library on this topic. </p>
      <p><i>Good Old Modern: an Intimate Portrait of the Museum of Modern Art</i> by
        Russell Lynes is a history of this museum from its founding in 1929 until
        1973 when the book was published. The author describes the people, events
        and collections that contributed to the development of the Museum of
        Modern Art.</p>
      <p><i>The Museum: 199 Years and the Metropolitan Museum of Art</i> by Leo Lerman,
        published in 1969, chronicles the story of the Metropolitan Museum from
        its opening in 1869. Many original photographs and drawings enhance the
        text. Included is background on acquisitions, exhibits, museum administrators
        and cultural history.<br>
          <br>
          Metropolitan Museum of Art publishes a quarterly <i>Bulletin</i>. The City
          Hall Library holds issues from 1969 to present. Articles on exhibits
          and collections by museum staff and art experts are featured. This
          publication provides a fascinating overview of the many and varied
          kinds of art that are available to the Museum visitor. </p>
      <p>American Museum of Natural History <i>Annual Report</i> offers financial statistics,
        information on programs and exhibits, highlights of the past year and
        other facts. Holdings cover 1877 to 2003.</p>
      <p><i>A New Brooklyn Museum: the Master Plan Competition</i>, published in 1986,
        features proposed designs for a renovation and refurbishment of the museum
        An open competition was held. Master plans from the five finalists are
        reproduced with original charts, photographs, drawings and explanatory
        text. The winner was Arata Isozaki and Associates.</p>
      <p>Vertical files are worth exploring for articles and other clippings
        on museums in general and particular. Find out more about various museums
        and how they contribute to the rich cultural life of the city.<br>
