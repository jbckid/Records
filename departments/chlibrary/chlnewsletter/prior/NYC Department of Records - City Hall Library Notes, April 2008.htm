    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: IMMIGRANT HISTORY</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_apr2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New
        York has always been known for welcoming immigrants. Whether they settled
        in New York City or other regions of the United States, immigrants have
        contributed greatly to American life and culture. In honor of Immigrant
        History Week, April 14 to April 20, 2008, this article features some
        resources on immigrants that may be found in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>The Newest New Yorkers</i> from the New York City Department of City Planning
        is usually published after every Federal census. Coverage begins with
        1980. This report provides comprehensive and helpful information for
        anyone researching recent immigration trends.</p>
      <p><i>Workers in the Metropolis: Class, Ethnicity, and Youth in Antebellum
        New York City</i> is by Richard B. Stott. This book examines the growth of
        industry and the working class in New York City from 1820 to 1860. Particular
        focus is on the addition of young immigrants to the labor force. Economic,
        social and cultural factors are considered.</p>
      <p><i>The Health of Immigrants in New York City</i> was published by the New York
        City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in 2006. General health
        care trends for foreign-born immigrants are considered. Also covered
        are specific issues such as access to care, HIV/AIDS, cancer, infant
        and maternal health and more. Findings and conclusions are discussed.
        Recommendations for improving health services for immigrants are provided.</p>
      <p><i>Immigration is Transforming New York City</i> was written by Mitchell L.
        Moss, Anthony Townsend and Emanuel Tobier for the Taub Urban Research
        Center at New York University. Published in 1997, this report highlights
        trends in immigration and the effects on demographics in the five boroughs.
        Statistical tables and charts add to the text.</p>
