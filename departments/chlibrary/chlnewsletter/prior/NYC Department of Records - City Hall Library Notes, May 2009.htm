      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  HISTORY OF NYC HOTELS</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_may2009.jpg" width="200" height="299" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>From
        the Biltmore to the Waldorf Astoria, New York City has been the home
        to hotels both luxurious and budget. Many of these buildings have been
        declared landmarks. This article features some resources in the City
        Hall Library collection on the subject of hotels.</p>
      <p><i>Peacock Alley: the Romance of the Waldorf-Astoria</i> by James Remington
        McCarthy in collaboration with John Rutherford was published in 1931.
        It is a historical and social chronicle of the old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
        at Fifth Avenue and Thirty-Fourth Street (now the location of the Empire
        State Building). The book describes the building of the hotel. Also included
        are anecdotes about famous guests and particular events, closing of the
        Waldorf at the old location and rebuilding on Park Avenue (where the
        Waldorf remains today).</p>
      <p><i>The Plaza: Its Life and Times, 1907-1967</i> was written by Eve Brown. Beginning
        with the story of three men with a vision for a luxury hotel, the book
        goes on to describe the early days of the Plaza. Changing economic and
        social conditions during the Great Depression and World War II played
        their roles. Also presented are stories of famous and infamous guests,
        how the legend of Eloise at the Plaza began, daily operations of the
        hotel and more.</p>
      <p><i>Budget Hotels in Greater Time Square: Times Square Hotels Study</i> was
        published in 1981 by the City Planning Commission and Department of City
        Planning. This report discusses the deterioration of hotels in the Times
        Square area and what could be done to improve them and attract tourists.
        Reasons for the decline are given along with analysis of the situation
        at the time and recommendations for improvement.</p>
      <p><i>Reductions in the City's Hotel Occupancy Tax Rate: the Impact
        on Revenues</i> was prepared by the Independent Budget Office (IBO). Published
        in 1997, this report focuses on changes in the hotel occupancy tax made
        in the 1980's and 1990's and their economic impact. Examined
        are the issues of tax revenues, direct and indirect fiscal impacts and
        resulting advantages.</p>
      <p>Many hotel buildings have been declared landmarks by the New York City
        Landmarks Preservation Commission. Among these are the Algonquin, the
        Ritz Tower and the Hotel Chelsea. Explore the vertical files for further
        materials on hotels. <br>
