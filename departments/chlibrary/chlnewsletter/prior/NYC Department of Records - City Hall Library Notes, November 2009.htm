      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: MAYORS</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nov2009.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>On
        November 3, New York City residents
        re-elected  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In honor of both Election Day
        and the Mayoral election, this article features some relevant resources
        in
        the
        City Hall
        Library
        collection.</p>
      <p>Edward I. Koch served as Mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989. He
        was known as a unique and colorful individual. <i>I&#8217;m not Done
        Yet!</i>        was
        written by Koch and Daniel Paisner. Published in 2000, this book discusses
        Koch's life after his Mayoral years. The former Mayor
        also talks about problems he encountered as he got older, including medical
        concerns. Besides recounting personal and career history, Koch also reflects
        on aging, keeping active and other issues.</p>
      <p><i>Leadership</i> by Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ken Kurson outlines the
        former Mayor's strategies for successful leadership and management. Giuliani
        presents his ideas within the context of his experiences as Mayor of
        New York City from 1994 to 2001. Among the topics covered are: accountability,
        personnel management, communicating effectively and developing assertiveness.</p>
      <p>The New York City Board of Elections has issued <i>Annual Reports</i> since
        1909. Results of all New York City elections that took place each year
        are published. Statistics for all candidates, including minority parties,
        are given. This might be a good place to find out who won the election
        for Queens Borough President in 1933, for example. Holdings in the City
        Hall Library include 1912 to 1969 and 1988 to 2007.</p>
      <p><i>The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and his Struggle to Save New
          York</i>        by Vincent J. Cannato chronicles the Lindsay administration from 1966
        to 1973. Particular attention is given to Lindsay&#8217;s reform agenda
        for New York City government and the administration&#8217;s efforts to
        revitalize the city. Unfortunately, political and social upheavals, increasing
        urban decay and incompetent management were some factors that contributed
        to the apparent failure of the Lindsay administration to effectively
        govern New York City. The author analyzes various social and political
        issues and events placing them in the context of the time period.</p>
      <p>Biographical files provide an excellent resource on New York City Mayors
        and other officials. Vertical files may also be explored for information
        on elections, government and related topics.</p>
