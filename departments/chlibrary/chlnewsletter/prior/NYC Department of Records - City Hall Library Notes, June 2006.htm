    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: THE TENEMENT IN NEW YORK CITY</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_urbancastle.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Tenements were originally constructed in the mid-nineteenth century
        to provide cheap housing for the poor, especially new immigrants. In
        1867, the Tenement House Law was passed to regulate conditions in these
        buildings. The City Hall Library contains many resources of interest
        on tenement housing including laws from the previous two centuries and
        the annual reports of the Tenement House Department, established in 1902.</p>
      <p><i>Urban Castles: Tenement Housing and Landlord Activism in New York
          City, 1890 to 1943</i> by Jared Day describes the role of landlordism
          and the history of tenement housing in the city. This study discusses
          the history of tenement developments, types of landlords, growth of
          landlord activism,
        role of government and courts, regulation of landlords and tenements
        and increasing tenant activism. Included are many photos of tenement
        houses, their residents and neighborhoods from the late nineteenth and
        early twentieth centuries.</p>
      <p><i>Let in the Sun</i> by Woody Klein tells the story of a building in
        East Harlem that opened in 1906. Although it was intended as a model
        tenement for poor families, conditions soon deteriorated. This book describes
        an experiment
        gone wrong and the inability of reformers and government to take any
        corrective action. The author also offers some guidelines for addressing
        the problems of housing for the poor.</p>
      <p><i>Challenge of Housing</i> by Langdon W. Post, a former Tenement House
        Commissioner and chairman of the NY City Housing Authority, offers a
        history of tenement
        and public housing in New York City. The focus is on the efforts to move
        beyond the tenement and develop safe, clean affordable housing for low-income
        urban residents. Problems and conditions of slum areas are discussed
        along with what the author believes was the failure of the government
        to enforce laws and regulations for housing. He describes the work of
        the Tenement House Department and the construction of the first public
        housing in
        New York City. This book was published in 1938.</p>
      <p>The Tenement House Law regulated the construction, maintenance and other
        aspects of tenements. The collection includes laws dating back to 1902.
        <i>First Report of the Tenement House Department of the City of New York</i>        was published in 1902-3 and the last in 1937. This publication offers
        useful information on the conditions of tenements, what needed to be
        improved and actions that were taken. Included are original complaints
        from tenants, diagrams of apartments and statistics. The Tenement House
        Department was abolished in 1937 and merged with the Department of Buildings
        to become the Department of Housing and Buildings.</p>
      <p><i>How the Other Half Lives</i> by Jacob Riis was originally published in 1890.
        It is a seminal work describing the tenements and the people who dwelt
        in them. Riis discusses the origins of the tenements, the various immigrant
        groups living in them, children of the slums and poverty. He also summarizes
        what had been done at that point to improve tenement life and what might
        be undertaken in the future.</p>
      <p>Vertical files contain articles and other clippings on the topic of
        tenement houses and the Tenement House Department.
