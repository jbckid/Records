    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON: AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE</b>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_battleforny.jpg" width="199" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">When the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776 in Philadelphia,
        New Yorkers reacted to the news of independence by knocking down a statue
        of George III that had been erected at Bowling Green, according to the
        <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>. In honor of American independence and
        the Revolution, find out more about some resources in the City Hall Library
        that are worth exploring.</p>
      <p><i>The Battle for New York: the City at the Heart of the American Revolution</i>        by Barnet Schecter tells the story of the British occupation of New York
        City in 1776 and the Continental Army&#8217;s struggle to regain control
        after retreating. The author traces the development of revolutionary
        politics in New York City, discusses the military campaign and battles
        of 1776, the importance of New York in the Revolution and profiles key
        figures such as Nathan Hale, Benedict Arnold, George Washington and British
        General William Howe.</p>
      <p><i>New York in the American Revolution</i> by Wilbur C. Abbott describes the
        growth of colonial New York and the beginnings of the movement for independence.
        <i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dividedloyalties.jpg" width="197" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></i>The bulk of the book is taken up with a study of politics in New York
        City during the Revolution, struggles to gain control of New York, life
        under the British occupation and the evacuation and departure of the
        British.</p>
      <p><i>Divided Loyalties: How the American Revolution Came to New York</i> by Richard
        M. Ketchum focuses on two families in New York, the Livingstons and the
        Delanceys, who fought on opposite sides during the Revolution. The author
        uses the experiences of the two families and other colonists to enhance
        the history and description of political, social and economic events
        that led to revolution. The focus is on events in New York and how New
        Yorkers chose sides in the war for American independence. Whether patriot
        or loyalist, each side held principles and convictions about America
        and how it should be governed.</p>
      <p><i>Documents and Letters Intended to Illustrate the Revolutionary Incidents
        of Queens County with Connecting Narratives, Explanatory Notes and Additions</i>        by
        Henry Onderdonk, Jr. is a collection of original documents and correspondence
        that offers the reader a perspective on the American Revolution in Queens
        County from those who actually lived through it. Included are reports
        by various committees to the 
        Continental Congress, list of recruits and payroll of the Queens County
        Militia, British proclamation relating to the occupation of Queens County
        and newspaper stories.</p>
      <p>Vertical file materials such as journal articles and clippings offer
        more about the American Revolution from a New York City perspective.<br>
