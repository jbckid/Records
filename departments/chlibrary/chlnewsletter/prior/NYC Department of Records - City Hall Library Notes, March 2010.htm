      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_mar2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Since
        1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March as Women's History Month.
        The City Hall Library contains a diverse collection of resources on women
        who have played significant roles in New York City politics, history
        and culture.</p>
      <p>          <i>Bella Abzug: How one Tough Broad from the Bronx Fought
          Jim Crow and Joe McCarthy: An Oral History</i> by Suzanne Braun Levine and Mary Thom,
            chronicles
          the life and career of the legendary Congresswoman who represented
            Manhattan's West Side from 1971 to 1977. Based on interviews with
            Abzug's daughters,
          colleagues, friends, and rivals, the authors present the story of Abzug's
          early years in the Bronx, her work as a civil rights lawyer, and her
          term in Congress. They narrate her activism in such areas as the women's
          movement and environmental awareness. Born in 1920, Bella Abzug died
          in 1998.</p>
      <p>          Bess Myerson served as New York City's first Commissioner of Consumer
            Affairs under Mayor Lindsay. During the Koch administration, she
            acted as Commissioner of Cultural Affairs. <i>Queen Bess</i> by Jennifer
            Preston
            is a biography published in 1990. The book traces Myerson's early
            years in the Bronx, her reign as the first Jewish Miss America in
            1945, and
            her work in civil rights, politics, and broadcasting.</p>
      <p>          Publications of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women
              may also be of interest to the researcher. This agency is now known
              as the
              New York City Commission on Women's Issues.<br>
