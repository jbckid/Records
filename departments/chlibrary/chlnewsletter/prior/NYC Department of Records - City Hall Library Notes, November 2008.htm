      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: PRESIDENTS</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nov2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">During
        November 2008, voters  go to the polls to elect a new President of
        the United States. In honor of the event, this article will highlight
        some resources on Presidents and First Ladies that can be found in the
        City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Obsequies of Abraham Lincoln in the City of New York</i> was prepared by
        the Common Council in 1866. Included in this compilation are eulogies
        from members of the Common Council, Board of Supervisors and other governing
        bodies in honor of President Lincoln after his assassination in 1865.
        Also featured is an account of the ceremonies that took place when the
        Lincoln funeral train arrived in New York City, and a viewing was held
        at City Hall. Illustrations enhance the text.</p>
      <p><i>John Adams</i> by David McCullough chronicles the life of the second President
        of the United States. Starting with Adams's role in the American
        Revolution, the author recounts Adams's life as a diplomat, his
        work as Vice President to George Washington, Presidential years and life
        afterwards. Two key relationships are emphasized: the marriage of John
        and Abigail Adams and John Adams's friendship/rivalry with Thomas
        Jefferson. Adams died in 1826.</p>
      <p><i>Theodore Roosevelt: the Man as I Knew Him</i> by Nicholas Roosevelt is a
        memoir of the former New York City Police Commissioner, who served as
        President of the United States from 1901 to 1908. Nicholas Roosevelt,
        a relative of Theodore Roosevelt, offers personal reminiscences of TR
        as well as historical details on his Presidency and life after the White
        House. TR died in 1919.</p>
      <p><i>This I Remember</i> by Eleanor Roosevelt is the second volume of her autobiography.
        This book covers her years in the White House as First Lady when Franklin
        D. Roosevelt (FDR) was President. Mrs. Roosevelt recounts some of the
        details of her earlier life then chronicles her experiences as First
        Lady from 1933 to 1945. Mrs. Roosevelt went on to a distinguished career
        of her own and died in 1962.</p>
      <p>Vertical and biographical files contain newspaper articles and other
        clippings on Presidents, elections and related topics.</p>
