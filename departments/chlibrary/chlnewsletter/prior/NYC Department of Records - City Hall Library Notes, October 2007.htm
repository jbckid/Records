    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ITALIAN-AMERICANS</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_oct2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        Giovanni da Verrazano explored New York Harbor in the sixteenth century,
        Italians have contributed greatly to New York City life, politics and
        culture. Italian immigrants began to arrive in large numbers in the late
        nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in search of better opportunities.
        In honor of Italian-American Heritage Month, this article focuses on
        some resources in the City Hall Library collection on Italian-Americans.</p>
      <p><i>The Italians of Greenwich Village</i> by Donald Tricarico studies the Italian
        community in this Manhattan neighborhood from the end of World War I
        to the early 1980's. Tricarico discusses the background of the
        Italian-American enclave in Greenwich Village, changing social and economic
        structures, effects of population decline and life in the community from
        the 1970's to the beginning of the 1980's.</p>
      <p><i>Leadership</i> by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani outlines his strategies
        for successful leadership and management. Giuliani presents his ideas
        within the context of his experiences as Mayor of New York City from
        1994 to 2001. Among the topics covered are, accountability, personnel
        management, communicating effectively and developing assertiveness.</p>
      <p><i>Vito Marcantonio: Radical Politician, 1902-1954</i> by Gerald Meyer tells
        the story of an Italian-American who represented East Harlem as a Congressman
        from 1934-36 and 1938-50. Marcantonio was leader of the American Labor
        Party and well-known for his leftist politics. The author chronicles
        Marcantonio's early influences and discusses the political organizations
        that supported him. Also considered are Marcantonio's affiliation
        with the Italian and Hispanic communities in East Harlem and his relationship
        with the Communist Party.</p>
      <p><i>Little Italy Special District</i> was published by the City Planning
        Commission in 1976. This report presents a plan for rezoning the Little
        Italy area
        in Manhattan. History of the neighborhood is given, along with plans
        for redesign and proposed new zoning. Photos and maps are included.</p>
      <p>In addition to these resources, look for biographies of Italian-Americans
        such as Geraldine Ferraro, Susan Molinari, and Fiorello LaGuardia. Biographical
        clippings on these figures and others like Peter Vallone, Vincent Impelliteri
        and Mario Cuomo can also be found in the collection.<br>
