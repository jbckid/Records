      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_oct2006.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New York Hospital, founded in 1791, was one of the first hospitals open
        in New York City. Since the eighteenth century, medical care has advanced
        rapidly and the municipal hospital system has undergone many changes.
        This article offers a sample of some resources on hospitals available
        in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p>Health and Hospitals Corporation was established in 1970 to administer
        the city's public health care system. <i>Annual Reports</i> were published
        from 1972 to 1994. Learn about the operations of the system, find out
        more about accomplishments and future objectives and read financial statements
        from the auditor's report. A precursor agency, Department of Hospitals,
        published an <i>Annual Report</i> from 1929 to 1967. These are a good source
        for historical statistics on hospitals and operations. </p>
      <p><i>Kings County Hospital Center Master Plan Report</i>, prepared in 1971, outlines
        the problems faced by this hospital trying to serve a population in North
        Central Brooklyn. The proposed plan included a redesign of the physical
        space to enlarge and enhance the facility. Original diagrams are included
        along with analysis of problems with the original hospital, community
        and patient profiles, timetable for reconstruction and operating data.</p>
      <p><i>The Bellevue Story</i> by Page Cooper describes the history of this famous
        public hospital from its establishment in the eighteenth century until
        1948. It started out as a charity hospital built on the present site
        of City Hall. Until the 1820's, Bellevue was better known for its
        unhealthy and unsafe conditions than anything else. Gradually, reforms
        came about, including the first hospital ambulance service, more sanitary
        conditions and better patient services. Bellevue is currently administered
        by the Health and Hospitals Corporation.</p>
      <p><i>Privatization and Public Hospitals: Choosing Wisely for New York
          City</i>        by Charles Brecher and Sheila Spiezio examines the possibility of privatization
        of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Published in 1995, this study
        considers the operations of HHC, its role in local health care, how future
        trends in health care might affect HHC, possible changes in policy for
        the administration of the agency and future trends.</p>
      <p>Vertical files feature articles and other clippings on both municipal
        and non-municipal hospitals. The biographical files provide background
        on city officials involved in health care administration and policy.
