      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: Black History Month</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
                        <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2011.jpg" alt="State Senator Constance Baker Motley with Mayor Wagner, February 7, 1963." width="280" height="224" hspace="8" vspace="4" border="1" align="left">February 
                          has been designated Black History Month in honor of 
                          Black culture and achievements. This article focuses 
                          on two prominent New Yorkers and highlights some resources 
                          in the City Hall Library collection related to Black 
                          history.</p>
                        <p>Constance Baker Motley was an African-American lawyer 
                          who worked on such pioneering civil rights cases as 
                          Brown v. Board of Education, which ended school segregation 
                          by race in 1954. Judge Motley served as a New York State 
                          Senator from 1964 to 1965. In 1965, she became the first 
                          woman to be elected Manhattan Borough President. Judge 
                          Motley achieved another milestone in 1966, when she 
                          became the first Black woman to be appointed to a federal 
                          judgeship. Her autobiography <em><strong>Equal Justice 
                          under Law</strong></em> recounts her personal life story 
                          and career. Judge Motley passed away in September 2005.</p>
                        <p>Basil Paterson was born in 1926 in Harlem, New York. 
                          He graduated from St. John&#8217;s University Law School 
                          and became active in Democratic politics along with 
                          David Dinkins, Percy Sutton and Charles Rangel. Paterson&#8217;s 
                          many achievements include serving in the New York State 
                          Senate; becoming the first African-American to be elected 
                          Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee; 
                          serving under Mayor Koch as Deputy Mayor of Labor Relations 
                          and Personnel; being appointed the first African-American 
                          to serve as Secretary of State in New York under Governor 
                          Hugh Carey. His son David Paterson served as Governor 
                          of New York State from March 2008 to December 2010.</p>
