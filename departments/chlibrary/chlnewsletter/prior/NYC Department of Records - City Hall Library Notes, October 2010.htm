      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: YOUTH</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_oct2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Various
        agencies have provided services to the young people of New York City
        such as after school activities, community outreach and employment among
        others. This article features some publications of different youth services
        agencies from the 1950s to the present.</p>
      <p><i>Juvenile Delinquency Rates and Socio-Economic Characteristics for
          New York City: a Manual for Social Research</i> was prepared by the Research
        Department of the New York City Youth Control Board in 1954. It offers
        information on juvenile delinquency statistics by health areas in New
        York City. Also included is data on population, income and housing. </p>
      <p><i>Mandate for Youth</i> discusses the work of the New York City Youth Board
        from 1947 to 1967. The formation and the various programs of the Youth
        Board are described. The main focus was on preventing juvenile delinquency
        and encouraging young adults to stay in school. </p>
      <p>In 1995, the Department of Youth Services offered <i>A New Direction
          in Youth Services</i>, written by Commissioner Alfred B. Curtis, Jr. This policy
        paper presents some goals and objectives for future management of the
        agency. </p>
      <p>Department of Youth and Community Development became a charter agency
        in 1996 by Local Law. The agency's <i>Annual Report</i> presents financial
        information, highlights of accomplishments for the year and description
        of organization and programs. DYCD is also active in the Interagency
        Coordinating Council on Youth, as stipulated in the City Charter. The
        <i>Annual Report</i> for ICC summarizes the quarterly meetings held and discusses
        the various contributions of the participating agencies in offering assistance
        to the city's young people.</p>
      <p>Vertical and biographical files may also be of use to the researcher.</p>
