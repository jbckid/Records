      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ELECTIONS</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nov2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">On
        November 2, 2010, voters in New York State elected Andrew Cuomo as the
        next governor. This article features some resources in the City Hall
        Library related to elections and governors that might be of interest.</p>
      <p>The New York City Board of Elections has issued <i>Annual Reports</i> since
        1909. Results of all New York City elections that took place each year
        are published. Results for gubernatorial elections are given for the
        five boroughs of New York City. Holdings in the City Hall Library cover
        1912 to 1969 and 1988 to 2007.</p>
      <p><i>The Life of Nelson A Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908-1958</i> was written
        by Cary Reich. This book chronicles the life of Rockefeller from birth
        to his election as Governor of New York State. Beginning with his youth
        as a member of one of the wealthiest families in the United States, the
        book then goes on to analyze Rockefeller's business and political
        accomplishments. Also considered are his family life, support of the
        arts and the 1958 gubernatorial election in New York State.</p>
      <p><i>Grover Cleveland by Rexford G. Tugwell</i> is a biography of the United
        States President, who also served as governor of New York State from
        1883 to 1884. During his brief tenure, Cleveland acquired a reputation
        as an effective, honest leader. Unfortunately, this experience did not
        appear to help Cleveland during his two terms of the Presidency.</p>
      <p><i>New Yorkers Make Their Voices Heard: a Report on the 2009 Elections</i>        was prepared by the New York City Campaign Finance Board. This publication
        reviews the 2009 elections, focusing on the voluntary Campaign Finance
        Program, overseen by the Board. Topics discussed include an overview
        of the 2009 elections, success of the Campaign Finance Program, and recommendations
        for future legislative changes.</p>
      <p>Other resources of interest are clippings files on elections, politics
        and related topics. Biographical files on political figures including
        New York State governors are also available.</p>
