    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: FIFTH AVENUE</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dec2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Traversing
        New York City from lower Manhattan to Harlem, Fifth Avenue is synonymous
        with elegance, commerce, and the Empire State Building. It is one of
        the premier streets in the City and often one of the first things that
        comes
        to mind when New York City is mentioned. This article highlights some
        publications on this famous thoroughfare that can be found in the City
        Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Fifth Avenue: a Very Social History</i> by Kate Simon chronicles
        the development of Fifth Avenue from the early nineteenth century to
        the 1970's.
        Included are the history of its founding, how Fifth Avenue became home
        to New York's wealthy, the growth of retail stores, and stories
        of some of the famous and not-so-famous residents and entrepreneurs.
        Neighborhoods such as Greenwich Village and the Flatiron District are
        discussed and the modern Fifth Avenue is considered.</p>
      <p>The Fifth Avenue Association published <i>Annual Reports</i> from 1907
        to 1936. The City Hall Library collection includes holdings from 1913
        to 1927.
        Included are reports on Association activities and lists of current officers
        and members. The Association dealt with issues such as building heights,
        traffic, snow removal, and noise. Their main purposes were to promote
        business in the Fifth Avenue district and to encourage social, civic,
        and industrial growth.</p>
      <p>Another Fifth Avenue Association title is the book <i>Fifth Avenue:
          Old and New, 1824-1924</i>. This work celebrates the centennial of
          Fifth Avenue in words and pictures. Take a guided tour of Fifth Avenue
          from Greenwich
        Village to midtown and learn about civic developments and such landmarks
          as Delmonico's restaurant, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the first traffic
          signal tower, and the Flatiron Building. Here is information
        about the families who lived along Fifth Avenue and the role of the Fifth
        Avenue Association in promoting civic development and pride.</p>
      <p><i>On Fifth Avenue: Then and Now</i> by Ronda Wist is another descriptive history
        of the street covering the early 19th century until 1992. Current and
        older photos provide a fascinating view of Fifth Avenue over the years.</p>
      <p>Many structures along Fifth Avenue have been declared landmarks. Designation
        reports from the Landmarks Preservation Commission on such entities as
        the Empire State Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Saks Fifth Avenue can
        be found in the City Hall Library collection. Consult the vertical files
        for articles and other clippings of interest.</p>
