    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: RETAILERS IN NEW YORK CITY</b></p>
      <p>Macy's, B. Altman's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Abraham & Straus
        are just some of the great department stores that have been located in
        New York City. Others like IKEA and Filene's Basement are relative
        newcomers. Retail stores, large and small, are an essential New York
        business. This article highlights some publications on department stores,
        shopping malls and the retail business.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomingdale's 100: Perspectives on a New York Tradition</i> celebrates
        the centennial of Bloomingdale's in 1972. The history of the store
        is presented along with photographs from various time periods and historical
        information about New York City over the years covered. Bloomingdale's
        was established in 1872 by two brothers of the same name and eventually
        expanded in terms of physical space, number of stores and merchandise
        offered.</p>
      <p><i>Retailing New York </i>is a report from the Manhattan Borough President's
        office published in June 1996. Surveys of both New York City residents
        and retailers were conducted. Findings and analysis are shown in the
        report. Case studies of seven shopping areas such as Arthur Avenue in
        the Bronx and Fulton Mall in Brooklyn are presented along with discussion
        of the typical users/shoppers, access to the stores, private and public
        investments, strengths and challenges. The retail economy in the city
        is also examined and recommendations for the future are offered.</p>
      <p><i>Great Merchants of Early New York: "The Ladies' Mile"</i> by
        Joseph Devorkin offers historical sketches of several New York retailers
        that opened for business on the famous "Ladies' Mile." This
        shopping area extended from 14th and the Union Square area, up Broadway
        to 23rd Street in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
        Many stores such as Lord & Taylor, Henri Bendel, F.A.O.Schwarz, and
        Bergdorf Goodman started here before eventual relocation or closure.
        Included are contemporary and historical photos and excerpts from original
        newspaper advertisements for the stores.</p>
      <p><i>IKEA Red Hook: Final Environmental Impact Statement</i> prepared by AKRF,
        Inc. and other consulting firms for the Department of City Planning is
        a study of conditions on the site of a proposed IKEA furniture department
        store. The report, required by law, as part of the land use process,
        discusses the socioeconomic factors, waterfront, environmental conditions
        and hazards and various other key elements. </p>

        stores and shopping malls. Find out more about shops, merchants, the
        retail business and what they contribute to the city's social life
        and economy.
