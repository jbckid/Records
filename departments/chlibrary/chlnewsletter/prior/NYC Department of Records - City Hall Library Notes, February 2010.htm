      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: BLACK HISTORY MONTH</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2010_1.jpg" alt="Percy Sutton, Adam Clayton Powell III, Deputy Mayor Paul Gibson, Manhattan Councilman Fred Samuel." width="300" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="left">February
        has been designated Black History Month in honor of African-American
        culture and achievements. This article features some related resources
        in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p>Several books deal with the black population and various issues they
        face as citizens of New York. <i>In the Black: A History of African-Americans
        on Wall Street</i> by Gregory S. Bell tells the story of African-Americans
        who set out to establish themselves in the security and investment banking
        fields despite prejudice, lack of funds and many other barriers in the
        time period of 1920 to today. <i>Caribbean New York: Black Immigrants
        and the Politics of Race</i> by Philip Kasinitz examines the role and identity
        of the West Indian community in New York. </p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2010_2.jpg" alt="David Dinkins, Heyward Davenport with wife and daugther, Percy Sutton, Mayor Abraham Beame, Deputy Mayor Paul Gibson." width="300" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="right">The Mayor's Commission on Black New Yorkers was established by
        Mayor Koch in January 1986 and completed their study in November 1988.
        The Commission found that black New Yorkers tended to be less educated
        and more economically disadvantaged than whites. This report offers possible
        solutions and also contains useful statistical information on education,
        economic development, poverty and employment.</p>
      <p>Biographies of such prominent African-Americans as Adam Clayton Powell,
        Jr., Shirley Chisholm, Constance Baker Motley and J. Raymond Jones are
        available to the researcher. Consult the biographical and clippings files
        for information on African-American politicians and officials as well
        as history, culture and life in New York City.<br>

      <p><b>PERCY
          SUTTON<br>
          <br>
          A Pioneering African-American City Official</b></p>
      <p><b><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2010_3.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="left"></b><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2010_4.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="right">Born
        November 24, 1920, to a father who began life in slavery, Percy Sutton
        grew up in San Antonio, Texas. After serving as intelligence officer
        in World War II, Sutton attended law school in New York City, supporting
        his family by working two jobs. Following additional military service
        during the Korean War, he opened a law practice in Harlem. In the 1950s
        and 1960s Sutton became active in the civil rights movement and political
        campaigns, finally winning a State Assembly seat in 1966. Later that
        year, the City Council selected Sutton to replace Constance Baker Motley
        as Manhattan Borough President after she resigned to accept appointment
        as a federal judge. In his private law practice Sutton represented the
        estate of Malcolm X, arranging for his burial at Ferncliff Cemetery in
        Hartsdale, New York, when every other local cemetery refused the remains
        of the assassinated black activist.</p>
      <p>In the November 1966 election, Manhattan Borough voters selected Sutton
        to serve out Motley's term; he went on to win two additional terms
        as Borough President. After an unsuccessful attempt to run for Mayor,
        in 1977, Sutton returned to private law practice and ownership of Inner
        City Broadcasting, a multimedia company with the Amsterdam News, and
        black-themed radio stations and cable franchises under its umbrella.
        A pioneer and leader in civil rights, politics and business, Percy Sutton
        died on December 26, 2009.</p>
      <p>The City Hall Library collection includes annual reports produced by
        Sutton as Borough President of Manhattan and the Municipal Archives maintains
        records from the office of the Borough President during his two-terms
        of service.</p>
