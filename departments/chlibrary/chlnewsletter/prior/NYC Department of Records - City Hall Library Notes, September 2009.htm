      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_sep2009.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>Since
        the early nineteenth century, public schools have provided quality education
        to New York City's children. . This article highlights some resources
        in the City Hall Library collection concerning elementary and middle
        schools.</p>
      <p><i>The Fourth "R": Rethinking Remediation in the Elementary
        Schools</i> was published by the Educational Priorities Panel in 1989. This
        report presents the results of a study of remediation programs in nine
        elementary schools. Issues considered are funding, monitoring and regulation
        of such programs, staffing and working with parents. Problems are discussed
        and recommendations for improvement are given.</p>
      <p><i>Course of Study and Syllabus in Reading for Elementary Schools: Grade
        1A - Grade 6B</i> was published in 1930 by the Board of Education. The
        publication outlines methods for teaching reading and offers sample courses
        of study for the teacher to utilize. There are similar historical curriculum
        guides in the CHL collection that may be of interest to the researcher.</p>
      <p><i>All Work and No Play: a Survey of Access to Physical Activity in
          New York City Public Elementary Schools</i> is a report of the Public Advocate
        from 2004. In this survey, the Public Advocate's Office studied
        100 elementary schools in order to determine if the schools offered adequate
        physical education programs. Findings revealed various problems. These
        include: schools with no physical education programs, lack of trained
        physical education teachers, no provision of the state-mandated time
        for physical education classes each week, etc. The findings are discussed
        and recommendations for improvement are presented.</p>
      <p><i>Middle School Task Force Report</i> was completed in 1988 by the Task Force,
        appointed by the Board of Education. This group of education professionals,
        parents and others examined curriculum, structure, staffing, parent and
        community involvement and other issues. Problems and needs are discussed
        with recommendations provided.</p>
