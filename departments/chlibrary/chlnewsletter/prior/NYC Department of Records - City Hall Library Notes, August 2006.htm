    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ELEVATED AND STREET RAILWAYS</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_railway.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">The
        first elevated railway in New York City was constructed from 1867 to
        1870. Many others were built as improvements were made in construction
        methods and rolling stock. Streetcars began running in 1832 under horsepower
        and were electrified in 1886. These facts come from the <i>Encyclopedia
        of New York City</i>. Both of these forms of transportation are obsolete
        (streetcar) or nearly (elevated railway). However, during the late nineteenth
        to the mid-twentieth centuries, many New Yorkers relied heavily on both
        the trolley and the "el" to travel around. This article features
        some publications on streetcars and elevated railways.</p>
      <p><i>The New York Elevated</i> by Robert C. Reed traces the history of
        elevated railways in New York City. Starting with the reasons for building
        the
        elevated railways in the 1860's, the book presents early ideas
        for els and the development of the elevated railways during the nineteenth
        and early twentieth centuries. Changing technology and financial maneuverings
        to get the railways built are considered. Also discussed is how the elevated
        railways affected daily life for riders and people who resided along
        the train routes, station design, operations and safety, electrification
        and the decline of the elevated railway. Photos and illustrations accompany
        the text.</p>
      <p><i>How We Got to Coney Island</i> by Brian J. Cudahy chronicles the growth
        of mass transit in Brooklyn by focusing on how travel to Coney Island
        changed over the years 1854 to 2000. The author provides a history of
        street railways, elevated railways and transit companies that developed
        in Brooklyn. Descriptions of the various equipment and building methods
        utilized are given along with changes and modernization in technologies.
        Later chapters concentrate on the expansion of the underground subway,
        Coney Island during World War II and present-day conditions. </p>
      <p><i>Report to the New York City Transit Authority: Demolition of Third
          Avenue Elevated Line South of 149th Street</i> was prepared by Colonel S.H. Bingham
        in May 1954. Bingham was the Executive Director and General Manager of
        the Transit Authority. Main reasons for demolition are presented along
        with supporting evidence. These reasons include declining usage, financial
        losses, easier alternative routes, greater potential for real estate
        development and others. Of special interest is a map of the Third Avenue
        El line with alternatives that could be used in its place by passengers
        once the elevated railway was demolished.</p>
      <p><i>Transit,</i> a monthly magazine published for Transit Authority
        employees, features an article in its April 1955 issue, entitled "End
        of an Era." The article summarizes the history of the Third Avenue El
        and reasons for demolition. Various photos of the elevated line stations,
        equipment, passengers and views from the trains enhance the text.</p>
      <p>Articles and other materials in the vertical files may also be of interest
        to the researcher. Explore the history and uniqueness of these vanished
        or nearly-vanished forms of transportation in New York City.
