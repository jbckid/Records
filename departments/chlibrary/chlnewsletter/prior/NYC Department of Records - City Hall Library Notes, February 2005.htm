    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH</b>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_whosaid.jpg" width="309" height="470" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March as Women&#8217;s History
        Month. The City Hall Library contains a diverse collection of resources
        on women who have played significant roles in New York City politics,
        history and culture.</p>
      <p><i>Silent Builder: Emily Warren Roebling and the Brooklyn Bridge</i> by Marilyn
        E. Weigold tells the story of the wife of the Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn
        Bridge, Washington Roebling. Mrs. Roebling assisted her husband in finishing
        the designs for the bridge after he was taken ill and negotiated with
        vendors, politicians and others to help ensure the that the bridge was
        completed. <i>Lillian Wald: Neighbor and Crusader</i> by R.L. Duffus is a biography
        of a wealthy young woman, who chose to devote her life to helping poor
        immigrants improve their lives at the Henry Street Settlement House on
        New York&#8217;s Lower East Side. Wald&#8217;s work was in the late nineteenth
        and early twentieth centuries.</p>
      <p>Emily Dunning Barringer was the first woman to work as an emergency
        ambulance surgeon in a New York City public hospital, beginning in 1903.
        Her memoir <i>Bowery to Bellevue: The Story of New York&#8217;s First Woman
        Ambulance Surgeon</i> chronicles her struggles and achievements. In <i>My
        Fight for Birth Control</i>, Margaret Sanger describes her work as a nurse and
        birth control activist in New York City. Sanger believed that women should
        have freedom of choice in the matter of family planning and access to
        contraception. She fought for these rights, often going to prison for
        violating various laws of the time that prohibited distribution and use
        of birth control.</p>
      <p>Many women have achieved success in the political world. Shirley Chisholm
        was the first African-American woman to be elected to the U.S Congress
        in 1968, representing a district in Brooklyn. <i>Unbought and Unbossed</i> is
        Chisholm&#8217;s account of her life and career. She started out as a
        worker in a Brooklyn Democratic club and eventually was elected to New
        York State Assembly and Congress. She became known as an advocate for
        the poor and for women&#8217;s rights. Geraldine Ferraro, a Congressional
        representative from Queens, was the first woman Vice-Presidential candidate
        in 1984. <i>Ferraro: My Story</i> focuses mainly on her experiences in the 1984
        presidential campaign and the challenges of being the first potential
        woman President. Elizabeth Holtzman served four terms in the U.S.Congress,
        was Brooklyn District Attorney and in 1989 became the first woman to
        be elected Comptroller of New York City. In her book, <i>Who Said it
        Would be Easy: One Woman&#8217;s Life in the Political Arena</i>, Holtzman discusses
        her career in public service. </p>
      <p>The Mayor&#8217;s Commission on the Status of Women published <i>Women
        Making History: Conversations with Fifteen New Yorkers</i> in 1985. The book
        features interviews with fifteen diverse New York women including Geraldine
        Ferraro, Beverly Sills and Charlayne Hunter-Gault. The Library also has
        copies of Mayoral Executive Orders nos. 28 of 1975 and 86 of 1987 establishing
        and modifying the Commission. The City Hall Library&#8217;s vertical
        files and biographical files also contain a wealth of information on
        the unique contributions of women to New York City life.</p>
      <p>In honor of Women's History Month, Department of Records is putting
         up images of New York City women. The exhibit <a href="http://nyc.gov/html/records/html/features/women.shtml">Continuity
         and Change: NYC Women on the Move</a>, contains materials from the
         Commission on Women&#8217;s Issues, the Women&#8217;s Advisors and city agencies. </p>

      <p><strong>HISTORICAL PHOTOS OF NEW YORK CITY HOUSES</strong></p>
      <p>Ever wondered what your house looked like 60 years ago?  Between
        1939 and 1941, the City photographed every house and building

        five
        Boroughs for tax purposes.
