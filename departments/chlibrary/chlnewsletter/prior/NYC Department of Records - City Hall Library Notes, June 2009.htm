      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  CENTRAL PARK</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jun2009.jpg" width="200" height="299" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>Central
        Park has been a part of the New York City landscape since it opened in
        1859. Extending over 843 acres, the Park is a refuge from hectic urban
        life for both New York residents and visitors. This article features
        some resources on Central Park that can be found in the City Hall Library
        collection.</p>
      <p><i>Report on Survey of Central Park with Recommendations</i> was prepared in
        1927 by Hermann W. Merkel for the Department of Parks. This report examines
        various issues of concern such as the conditions of lawns, lack of adequate
        police presence and administration of parks operations. Recommendations
        for improvement are presented.</p>
      <p><i>Rebuilding Central Park: a Management and Restoration Plan</i> with Elizabeth
        Barlow Rogers as principal author was published in 1987. The Department
        of Parks and Recreation collaborated with the Central Park Conservancy
        on this plan to rehabilitate and restore the park. An analysis of conditions
        in the park is presented along with consideration of individual areas
        for renovation and what steps might be taken to improve them. Maps and
        photographs enhance the printed text.</p>
      <p>The Central Park Conservancy was established in 1980 as a joint venture
        between city government and the private sector. <i>Annual Reports</i> of this
        organization document activities and accomplishments. Financial statements
        and lists of major contributors are also given. Holdings are from 1981
        to 2002. </p>
      <p><i>The Park and the People: a History of Central Park</i> by Roy Rosenzweig
        and Elizabeth Blackmar chronicles the history of the park from its beginnings
        to the late twentieth century. Included are the story of the creation
        and building of Central Park along with political, economic and other
        issues involved. The movement to make Central Park accessible to all
        people not just the wealthy is discussed as well as the changes that
        took place in the twentieth century and new challenges.</p>
      <p>Vertical files feature articles and other clippings. Biographical articles
        on parks officials are also available.<br></p>
