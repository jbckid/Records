      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: CHILDREN'S HEALTH</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_oct2009.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>There
        are many significant issues involved in child welfare. Among the key
        concerns are physical and mental health of children. This article highlights
        some resources in the City Hall Library collection that focus on children's
        health.</p>
      <p><i>School Health News</i> was published by the New York City Department of
        Health from 1915 to 1925. Appearing monthly during the school year, this
        newsletter features information on contagious diseases among children,
        preventive care, dental health, nutrition, etc. Other historical publications
        such as the <i>Reprint</i> series include articles and monographs on child health
        and hygiene from the early 1900's to the 1950's.</p>
      <p><i>The Future of Child Health in New York City</i> was prepared by the Mayor's
        Commission on the Future of Child Health for the Department of Health
        in 1989. The Commission considers a number of key issues such as available
        programs and services, utilization of these services, financing, problems
        with the current system and ideas for improvement. The study largely
        concentrates on the underprivileged. Statistical tables and charts supplement
        the text.</p>
      <p><i>Lead & Kids: Why are 30,000 NYC Children Contaminated?</i> was published
        by the Public Advocate's Office in 1998. This report discusses
        the severity and extent of lead poisoning among children in New York
        City. The primary causes of lead poisoning are presented as well as the
        effects on children and families. Recommendations for preventing lead
        poisoning through landlord responsibility and legislative action are
        given.</p>
      <p><i>Still in Crisis: the Health Status of New York's Homeless Children</i>        was written by Irwin Redlener, MD and Dennis Johnson for the Children's
        Health Fund in 1999. The problems of homeless children including higher
        incidence of disease, lack of regular pediatric care, scarcity of health
        services available, etc. are considered. Statistics are presented to
        support the authors' ideas. Possible solutions for alleviating
        this crisis are presented.</p>
      <p>Other materials of interest include vertical files on children's
        health, diseases, child welfare and more.</p>
