      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: IMMIGRANT HISTORY</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_apr2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">In
        honor of Immigrant History Week, April 15 to April 21, 2010, this article
        features resources that can be found in the City Hall Library collection.
        New York has always been known as a city of immigrants. Whether they
        settled in New York City or other regions of the United States, immigrants
        have contributed greatly to American life and culture. </p>
      <p><i>The Newest New Yorkers</i> from the New York City Department of City Planning
        is usually published after every Federal census. Coverage begins with
        1980. This report provides comprehensive and helpful information for
        anyone researching recent immigration trends.</p>
      <p>        <i>The Ellis Island Immigrant Cookbook</i> by Tom Bernardin is a compilation
          of recipes from immigrants and their descendants. Recipes are listed
          by country of origin. Learn how to make Italian stuffed eggplant, Danish
          apple cake, Jamaican oxtail stew and other dishes. Also included is
          background information on Ellis Island, plus advice on compiling and
          preserving family recipes and tracing genealogy. </p>
      <p><i>All the Nations under Heaven: an Ethnic and Racial History of New
          York City</i> by Frederick M. Binder and David M. Reimers chronicles the experiences
        of immigrant groups as they arrived in New York and became part of life
        here. Beginning with the days of Dutch colonization, the focus is on
        how immigrants sought to adapt to their new land while maintaining unique
        social and cultural identities. Also explored are the interactions of
        various ethnic and racial groups. The authors aim to show how the arrival
        and settlement of immigrants transformed New York life and continue to
        do so.</p>
      <p>Vertical files and biographical articles may also be of assistance in
        exploring more facets of this topic. Find out more about our predecessors
        who helped contribute to the diversity of New York City and the immigrants
        who continue the tradition.      </p>
