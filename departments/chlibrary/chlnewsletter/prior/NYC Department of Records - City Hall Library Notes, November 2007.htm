    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK CITY RAILROADS</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nov2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">With
        the opening of the New York and Harlem Railroad in 1832, New York City
        entered a more modern age of transportation. The Long Island Railroad
        was chartered in 1834. Railroads are still a part of the transit picture
        in New York City especially for commuters. Here are some resources in
        the City Hall
        Library collection on this topic.</p>
      <p><i>Queens-Long Island Rail Transit: a Transit Strategy for a Growing
          Metropolitan Corridor</i> was prepared by Joseph McC. Leiper for the Department of City
        Planning in 1965. This report outlines problems with the commuter transit
        system as it existed then. Changing commuter needs and demands for better
        service are discussed along with possible strategies for improvement.</p>
      <p><i>The Port of New York: a History of the Rail and Terminal System from
        the Grand Central Electrification to the Present</i> by Carl W. Condit is
        a two-volume history of rail transportation in New York City. Developments
        in the nineteenth century and the building of terminals such as Grand
        Central are chronicled. The history of electrification of railroads and
        building of Pennsylvania Station are also presented. This book was published
        in 1980 and contains many useful photos and maps.</p>
      <p><i>Grand Central</i> by David Marshall was published in 1946. This book describes
        a typical day at Grand Central Station during the 1940's. Interspersed
        with anecdotes about the terminal and the people in it, are history of
        the station and discussion of how the railroads and rolling stock functioned.
        Photos are included.</p>
      <p><i>New York's Pennsylvania Stations</i> by Hilary Ballon presents the
        history of this landmark railroad terminal in words and pictures. Included
        are history of the first structure, destruction and rebuilding of the
        station in the 1960's and planned renovation in the new millennium.
        Architectural details are discussed along with changing commuter and
        business needs. Many photos and drawings enhance the text. </p>
