<p><b>
      SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK CITY PARKS</b></p>
   
    <i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_boroughs.jpg" alt="East Side, West Side" width="202" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>Parks in New York City have always been a refuge from the noise, crowds and
    fast pace of urban life. The City Hall Library collection features a rich
    assortment of materials on the parks in New York City. There&#8217;s plenty
    on Central Park but you can find out about many other parks in the 28,626
    acres of city parkland (this information courtesy of the <i>2003-04 Green
    Book</i>).
    <p><i>East Side, West Side: A Guide to New York City Parks in All Five Boroughs</i>      by Lee Ann Levinson describes parks in all five boroughs with information
      on facilities, directions, activities, unique features and nearby places
      of interest. <i>Public Space for Public Life: A Plan for the Twenty-first
      Century</i> a report by a coalition group of city officials and private citizens,
      offers proposals for improving existing parks and creating new ones so
      that all New Yorkers and visitors may enjoy the benefits of the parkland.</p>
    <p>Central Park takes the spotlight in <i>The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted:
      Creating Central Park</i>.
      Included are the text of the original report on Greensward, the design
      for Central Park,written by Olmsted and his partner, Calvert Vaux; correspondence
      and a pictorial essay of the early years of the Park. <i>Bridges of Central
      Park</i> by Henry Hope Reed, Robert M. McGee and Esther Mipaas, complete with
      drawings, describes bridges and arches in the park. Details include history,
      location, measurements and architectural features.<img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_bridges.jpg" alt="Bridges of Central Park" width="300" height="213" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>
    <p>City agency publications include Parks Department annual reports dating
      back to the nineteenth century. The Department of Parks and Recreation
      has published <i>Three Hundred Years of Parks: A Timeline of New York City
      Park History</i>, offering a chronology of park history from 1686 through the
      Robert Moses years to 1987. Featuring numerous color photographs and illustrations,
      <i>Woodlands, Wetlands &amp; Wildlife: A Guide to the Natural Areas of New
      York City Parks</i>, describes the wetlands, forests, meadows and wildlife
      to be found in New York City parks.</p>
    <p>Vertical files contain news clippings, maps, photos, magazine articles
      and various materials about individual parks and the subject of parks in
      general. Several files are devoted exclusively to Central Park, including
      history and special features of the park. So before you retreat to your
      favorite park, why not come by the City Hall Library and learn something
      about it first?
