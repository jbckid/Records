    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: TOURISM</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jul2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Millions
        of visitors come to New York City every year. There is something for
        everyone to see and do. This article highlights some resources in the
        City Hall Library collection that cover the topic of tourism.</p>
      <p><i>Wish You were Here: a Program to Boost Tourism and Create Jobs in
          New York City</i> by the New York City Comptroller was published in 1993. This
        report discusses the effect of a higher hotel occupancy tax on tourism
        and what can be done to mitigate this situation. Benefits of promoting
        and encouraging tourism are presented and recommendations are given.</p>
      <p>The Department of City Planning studied the tourist industry in New
        York City from 1974 to 1977 and prepared New York City's Visitors
        Industry. Statistics on visitors' expenditures, transportation,
        different types of visitors, employment in the tourism industry, etc.
        are provided. The work of the <i>Convention and Visitors Bureau</i>, as it was
        then known, is analyzed and compared to similar organizations in other
        major cities. The report ends with recommendations for enhancing and
        upgrading the tourism industry.</p>
      <p>New York Tourism 2000 Committee was organized by the New York City Convention & Visitors
        Bureau to study tourism in New York City and focus on key issues for
        the upcoming new millennium. Published in 1992, the report, <i>New York
        City Tourism 2000</i>, analyzes the concept of tourism in general. Its impact
        on the world, the U.S. and the city, and other key issues are considered.
        Goals and strategies for future development are presented.</p>
      <p>The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau issued Annual Reports. These
        publications detail the Bureau's efforts to promote tourism and
        attract visitors to the city. Included are statistics on number of visitors,
        accomplishments of the Bureau and descriptions of various programs and
        activities. Holdings are from 1967 to 1970. Incidentally, the Bureau
        was renamed NYC & Company after merging with the group, New Yorkers
        for New York in 1999. </p>
      <p>Vertical files on tourism and visitors include newspaper articles, other
        clippings and brochures that may be of interest. </p>
