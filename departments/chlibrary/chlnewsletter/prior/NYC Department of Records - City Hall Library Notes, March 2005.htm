    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  IRISH-AMERICAN NEW YORKERS</b>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_happywarrior.jpg" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Irish-Americans have always been an integral part of New York City,
        contributing to political, economic and social life. St. Patrick&#8217;s
        Day is a celebration of all things Irish. In honor of this day and the
        achievements of Irish-Americans, here is a sample of some of the materials
        available in the City Hall Library.</p>
      <p><i>A Revolutionary Conservative: James Duane of New York</i> by Edward P. Alexander
        tells the story of the first Mayor of New York City after the American
        Revolution. Appointed to the position in 1784, Duane was a prominent
        lawyer and landowner and member of the Continental Congress, who helped
        New York City rebuild after the revolution. <i>Beau James: Life of Jimmy
        Walker</i> by Gene Fowler chronicles the life of a former songwriter, who
        became Mayor of New York from 1926 to 1932. Under his leadership at first,
        improvements were made to city government. However, after being investigated
        by the Seabury Commission for alleged corruption, Walker was forced to
        leave office.</p>
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_daysofwine.jpg" width="255" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Alfred E. Smith: the Happy Warrior</i> by Christopher M. Finan offers a
        look at the life of the governor of New York State from 1919 to 1928
        and the first Catholic candidate for President of the United States in
        1928. This book explores Smith&#8217;s personal, financial and political
        achievements and setbacks. <i>In Counsel for the Defense</i>, Paul O&#8217;Dwyer
        recounts his life story from childhood in Ireland to arrival in America
        and success in law and politics in New York City. O&#8217;Dwyer worked
        as an attorney helping labor leaders accused of Communism and fighting
        for the cause of civil rights. He served as City Council President from
        1974 to 1978. </p>
      <p><i>The Days of Wine and Roses are Over</i> by Daniel C. Kramer reviews the
        gubernatorial career of Hugh L. Carey, governor of New York State from
        1975 to 1982. Carey worked to assist New York City with its financial
        troubles in 1975, signing legislation to establish the Emergency Financial
        Control Board and doing battle with the federal government to obtain
        financial aid for the city. <i>The Gentleman from New York</i> by Godfrey Hodgson
        is a biography of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who represented New
        York in the U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2000. The book discusses Moynihan&#8217;s
        middle-class childhood and youth spent in Oklahoma, Indiana and New York
        City; his work for the Nixon administration as chief domestic advisor;
        diplomatic service as ambassador to India and later to the United Nations
        and Moynihan&#8217;s illustrious Senate career. </p>
      <p>Another book of interest is <i>The Man Who Ran the Subways: the Story
          of Mike Quill</i> by L.H. Whittemore. Quill was president of the Transport Workers
        Union during the 1966 transit strike. Originally from County Kerry, Ireland,
        Quill arrived in New York City in 1926, worked as a subway token clerk
        and helped form the Transport Workers Union. Known for his fiery personality,
        Quill led his workers out on strike in 1966, virtually shutting down
        the city for nearly two weeks.</p>
      <p>Biographical files in the City Hall Library contain articles on Irish
        American politicians, officials and others of note. There is also a vertical
        file on the Irish in New York City and one on the St. Patrick&#8217;s
        Day parade, providing background and news stories for further research. <br>
