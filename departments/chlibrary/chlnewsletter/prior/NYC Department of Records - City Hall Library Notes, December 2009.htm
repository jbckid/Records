      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN NYC</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dec2009.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" border="1" align="left"></i>Collegiate
        School, the oldest independent school in the United States, opened in
        New York City in 1628. Since then, many private schools, some independent
        and some with religious affiliations, have been established in the city.
        This article features some resources in the City Hall Library on private
        schools.</p>
      <p><i>Private Independent Schools</i> is a directory of private schools by state.
        Many New York City schools such as Collegiate, Dalton, Nightingale-Bamford
        and Mary Louis Academy are included. Information is given on the mission
        of each school, courses of study, tuition etc. </p>
      <p><i>Private Schools for the Handicapped</i> was prepared by the City Planning
        Commission in 1973. This publication discusses a program for placing
        developmentally and emotionally disabled children in private schools
        when no appropriate courses of instruction were available in public schools. </p>
      <p><i>Three out of Ten: the Nonpublic Schools of New York City</i> was published
        by the Department of City Planning in 1972. The report surveys 841 private
        schools, both religious and non-sectarian. Issues reviewed include comparison
        of student performance in public and Catholic schools, analyses of Catholic
        and Jewish schools, government assistance to private school pupils and
        legislation. Various financial and legal options such as tuition reimbursement,
        state aid to private schools, educational vouchers are considered.</p>
      <p><i>Catholic Schools in the City of New York</i> was written by Raymond Domanico
        for the New York University Program on Education and Civil Society in
        2001. This report compares academic performance of Catholic elementary
        schools in New York City to public schools. Data is presented and analyzed.
        Conclusions and implications for future public policy are presented.</p>
      <p>Some school buildings have been declared landmarks by the Landmarks
        Preservation Commission. These <i>Designation Reports</i> can be located in
        the City Hall Library collection as well as newspaper and other clippings
        from the vertical files.</p>
