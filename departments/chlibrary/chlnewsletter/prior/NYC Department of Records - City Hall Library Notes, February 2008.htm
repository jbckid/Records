    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: BLACK HISTORY MONTH</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_feb2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">February
        has been designated Black History Month in honor of African-American
        culture and achievements. This article focuses on some resources on African-Americans
        in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Knocking at Our Own Door: Milton A. Galamison and the Struggle to
          Integrate New York City Schools</i> by Clarence Taylor chronicles how Galamison, a
        Presbyterian minister, became active in the movement to integrate New
        York City schools in the 1960's. Included are discussions of Galamison's
        work with the NAACP and other organizations, history of the struggle
        to integrate, and the achievement of desegregation. Galamison's
        later activities in the school decentralization movement and as a member
        of the Board of Education are examined. He died in 1988.</p>
      <p><i>The Many Places of Black Men</i> was prepared in 1992 by the Commission
        on African American Males. Composed of fifty-four members, appointed
        by then Borough President Ruth Messinger, the Commission held several
        sessions and workshops where key issues were identified and discussed.
        Included are reflections on growing up African-American, problems faced
        and future possibilities.</p>
      <p>The Mayor's Commission on Black New Yorkers was established by
        Mayor Koch in January 1986 and completed its <i>Report</i> in November 1988.
        The Commission found that black New Yorkers tended to be less educated
        and more economically disadvantaged than whites. This report offers possible
        solutions to assist black New Yorkers and also contains useful statistical
        information on education, economic development, poverty and employment.</p>
      <p>Consult the biographical clippings files for information on the lives
        and careers of African-American politicians and officials. The library
        catalogue and vertical files also contain diverse resources on African-American
        history, culture and life in New York City.</p>
