      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: THE BRONX</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jul2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">The
        Bronx is the northernmost borough of New York City and the only one located
        on the mainland. First settled in 1639 by Jonas Bronck, the Bronx today
        is home to a diverse population, culture and history. This article highlights
        some resources in the City Hall Library collection about the Bronx.</p>
      <p><i>History in Asphalt: the Origin of Bronx Street and Place Names</i> by John
        McNamara was published in three editions, the last one in 1991. This
        book presents brief histories of individual streets and place with details
        on origins of the name, date of naming, location and prior names, if
        any. </p>
      <p><i>South Bronx Rising: the Rise, Fall and Resurrection of an American
          City</i>        by Jill Jonnes chronicles the story of the South Bronx
          neighborhood, its development, deterioration and resurgence. The author
          describes the
        history and development of the South Bronx, discusses economic issues
        and the impact of immigration, moves on to the decline of the area in
        the 1960s and 1970s then concludes with a study of the
        rebuilding efforts. This is an updated edition of an earlier book that
        Jonnes wrote about the South Bronx.</p>
      <p><i>Memories of Fordham</i> by Rocky D'Erasmo is a collection of
        reminiscences about the Fordham neighborhood in the Bronx. The author,
        family and friends
        contribute anecdotes, letters and photos about growing up and living
        in the Bronx from the 1930s to the 1970s. </p>
      <p><i>The Bronx: It was Only Yesterday, 1935-1965</i> by Lloyd J. Ultan
        and Gary Hermalyn, is written in collaboration with the Bronx County
        Historical
        Society. This book is one of five, co-written by Professor Ultan, the
        Bronx Borough Historian, on Bronx history. In this volume, the authors
        discuss the impacts of the Depression, World War II, new technology,
        construction and other factors on the borough and its people. Many photographs
        from the Historical Society collections enhance the text and provide
        detail for the researcher.</p>
      <p>Also available in the collection are vertical files with clippings on
        Bronx neighborhoods, biographical files and designation reports for landmarks
        in the borough. These are a small part of the fascinating resources in
        the collection.</p>
