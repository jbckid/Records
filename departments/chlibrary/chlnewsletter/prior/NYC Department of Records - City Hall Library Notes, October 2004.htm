    <td>    <strong>SPOTLIGHT ON:  ELECTIONS</strong>
      <p>Election Day is approaching, November 2 to be exact. There are many
        choices to make that will affect the voters for years to come. The City
        Hall Library includes many resources on elections for the researcher,
        interested voter or anyone else just curious. This article provides just
        a small sample of what can be discovered.</p>
      <p>The New York City Board of Elections has issued annual reports for 1909
        to 1969 and 1987 to 2001.Results of all New York City elections that
        took place that year are published and the statistics for all candidates
        including minority parties are given. This report might be a good place
        to find out who won the election for Queens Borough President in 1933,
        for example. Also, the City Record published <i>Official Canvass of Votes</i>,
        from the early twentieth century to the 1970&#8217;s, which organizes
        voting statistics for each year&#8217;s election by county, type of election
        and districts. National as well as state and local races are covered.
        Useful information on voter registration and turnout may be found. Actual
        lists of registered voters from 1965 to 1975 by borough and Assembly
        District can be located in the collection, too. </p>
      <p><img src="../../images/newsletter_changing.jpg" width="200" height="309" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Citizens Union publishes a Voter&#8217;s Directory for each yearly primary
        and general election. The Library keeps these directories from 1953 to
        the present. Background is given on all candidates and ballot proposals
        such as bond issues, along with Citizens Union recommendations. Election
        district maps are also printed. The Library also has various historical
        election maps in its collection, dating from the nineteenth century to
        the present.</p>
      <p>Election maps from 1960 to 1998 can be accessed in the file drawers
        in the main reference room. </p>
      <p>Vertical files feature newspaper and magazine articles on elections
        and election results dating back to the 1960&#8217;s. Not only city and
        state but Presidential elections are covered and newspapers like the
        New York Times, Daily News and discontinued papers such as the New York
        Herald Tribune are represented. These files also include background articles
        on the elections.</p>
      <p>Another excellent source is the Politics vertical files. Not only are
        there newspaper and magazine articles about candidates and elected officials
        but you can also find original campaign literature. In 1961, Robert Wagner
        appealed to minority voters in English and Spanish to vote for him in
        the primary election for Mayor. The original flyers are here. Also, there
        is a Robert F. Kennedy for Senator Poster and a packet of campaign materials
        from John Lindsay in 1969. </p>
      <p>For background on the municipal election of 1989 which brought David
        Dinkins, the first African-American Mayor to power, there is <i>Changing
        New York City Politics</i> by Asher Arian, Arthur S. Goldberg, John H. Mollenkopf
        and Edward T. Rogowsky. The authors explore the background of the Mayoral
        campaign and election and try to analyze the key issues in the election. <br>
