    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  NEW YORK CITY STREET NAMES</b>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_thestreet.jpg" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Street names in New York City often have varied and fascinating origins.
        The City Hall Library collection offers a number of resources for anyone
        interested in researching this topic. </p>
      <p>The Street and Place Name index is a comprehensive card file listing
        of streets in the five boroughs, both named and numbered, as well as
        places such as parks, squares, triangles, etc. Organized alphabetically
        by street or place name, cards list former name(s) if any, date name
        was changed, law or resolution designating name change and who or what
        the street was named after. Any sources consulted such as City Council
        Proceedings or historical books are cited for further reference.</p>
      <p><i>The Street Book: Encyclopedia of Manhattan&#8217;s Street Names and
        Their Origins</i> by Henry Moscow, features maps, photos and drawings, presents
        short histories of various Manhattan street names. <i>History in Asphalt:
        the Origin of Bronx Street and Place Names</i> by John McNamara is a guide
        to that borough, though not illustrated.</p>
      <p>        <i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_asphalt.jpg" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></i>Fifth Avenue, the street that divides the East and West sides,
        is profiled in <i>On Fifth Avenue: Then and Now</i> by Ronda Wist and <i>Fifth
        Avenue</i> by
          Theodore James, Jr.
        The first book includes descriptive history of Fifth Avenue from the
        early 19th century until 1992 with photos and drawings. The book by Theodore
        James, Jr. is mainly a pictorial history of the avenue. Visit the home
        of St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral and Saks Fifth Avenue and appreciate
        the marvels of this street.</p>
      <p><i>The Street that Never Slept</i> by Arnold Shaw tells the story of 52nd
        Street or Swing Street, once the center of the entertainment scene, now
        home to mostly office buildings. Interviews and photos highlight the
        story of speakeasies, debutantes, jazz musicians and other assorted places
        and characters that were part of the street from the 1920s to the 1950s. </p>
      <p>Broadway, possibly the longest street in the world, the Great White
        Way, is the subject of <i>On Broadway: a Journey Uptown over Time</i> by David
        W. Dunlap. It includes a history of the street by area, starting with
        downtown Manhattan and ending in Washington Heights/Marble Hill. A wealth
        of photos and descriptions of buildings and other sites complement the
        text. Incidentally, according to the <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>, the
        moniker &#8220;Great White Way,&#8221; comes from the large number of
        electric signs, used for advertising mainly in the theatre district.</p>
      <p>Also, the vertical files include articles on street name history and
        individual streets. So be sure to take advantage of these great resources.</p>
