    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ROCKEFELLER CENTER</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_rockefeller1.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Rockefeller
        Center is the home of Radio City Music Hall, the General Electric (formerly
        RCA) Building, a skating rink and a statue of Prometheus among other
        landmarks. In honor of Rockefeller Center and the annual holiday spectacular
        at Radio City Music Hall, this article highlights some of the resources
        available in the City Hall Library on this area.</p>
      
     

      <p><i>Rockefeller Center: Architecture as Theater</i> by Alan Balfour offers a
        history of the construction of Rockefeller Center with the focus on the
        architecture. Learn more about the individual and architectural firms
        involved in the planning and design. Included are descriptions of buildings,
        a discussion of the artwork and profiles of artists, commentary on Rockefeller
        Center from architects, historians and journalists from the 1940&#8217;s
        to the 1970&#8217;s.<i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_rockefeller2.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></i></p>
      <p><i>The Last Rivet</i> presents the texts of speeches made at the opening ceremonies
        of the Rockefeller Center complex on November 1, 1939. Nelson Rockefeller,
        future Governor of New York State; David Sarnoff, President of RCA, Mayor
        Fiorello LaGuardia and others describe the building of the Center and
        what it will mean to New York City.</p>
      <p><i>Rockefeller Center</i>, published in 1932, by Rockefeller Center, Inc.,
        features drawings and photos of the buildings already erected and of
        proposed structures. It is interesting to note that at one time an opera
        house and concert hall were going to be part of Rockefeller Center, in
        order to provide homes for the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic
        orchestra.</p>      
      <p>The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Rockefeller
        Center as a Historic District in 1985. The complete <i>Rockefeller Center
        Designation Report</i> explains the reasons for designation, contains
        biographies of the owner, developers and architects and describes each
        building and
        the gardens and public spaces in the area. This report provides a wealth
        of information on architectural details, structure, design and artwork.
        Radio City Music Hall was designated a landmark building in 1978 and
        the report is included in the collection here.</p>
      <p>Vertical files on Rockefeller Center and Radio City offer newspaper
        and magazine articles and other materials that may be of interest. Read
        about the designation of Radio City Music Hall as a landmark and its
        renovation in the late 1970&#8217;s. A Municipal Art Society pamphlet,
        written in 1932, discusses the significance of Rockefeller Center as
        a symbol of both commercial and artistic accomplishment.<br>
