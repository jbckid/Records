    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: NYC HUMAN RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_sep2006.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Human Resources Administration (HRA) was established by Mayor John Lindsay's
        Executive Order No. 28 dated August 15, 1966. The agency oversees various
        social services and programs that assist New Yorkers in need of them.
        Here is an overview of some of the publications of HRA that can be found
        in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Annual Reports</i> from HRA were published in 1969, 1972, 1976 and
        1987. This publication contains information on various programs and accomplishments
        of the agency along with statistics. <i>Commissioner's Special Report</i>,
        published in April 2005, discusses activities and achievements of HRA
        for 2004-2005 and offers various statistics. Future goals and objectives
        are also considered. <i>A Time of Examination, a Time of Discovery, a
        Time of Accomplishment: January 2002 - June 2003</i> is a similar publication
        reviewing HRA programs and accomplishments.</p>
      <p><i>District Resource Statement</i> is an annual compilation of data
        prepared for the city's community boards by various city agencies and
        coordinated
        by the Office of Management and Budget. The report for HRA presents information
        on services offered directly or through contracted agencies in each community
        district. Included is statistical information on population, household
        income, and number of recipients for such programs as public assistance,
        Medicaid and food stamps. Also, there are listings of both HRA offices
        and outside contractors that provide services to the community districts.
        You can find copies of this publication dating back to the first issue
        in 1982, in the City Hall Library. </p>
      <p>Over the years, HRA research analysts have prepared reports on such
        topics as Medicaid expenditures and recipient population, food stamp
        programs, public assistance recipients and the cost of welfare, and HIV/AIDS
        services. For example, <i>Dependency</i>, published semi-annually from
        1984 to 1988, is a report on both poverty and social service programs
        offered
        by HRA which includes numerous statistical tables and charts. <i>Low-Income
        Populations in New York City: Economic Trends and Social Welfare Programs</i>,
        published annually from 1994 to 1996 by HRA and United Way of New York,
        was the successor publication.</p>
      <p><i>Welfare Reform in Motion</i> examines the recent changes made in public
        assistance programs by HRA/ Department of Social Services (DSS). Discussed
        are reworking of service delivery, restructuring and modernizing DSS
        operations, and programs to encourage self-sufficiency in welfare recipients
        among other issues. Future goals and objectives are examined, too.</p>
      <p>Find out more about the history of HRA by using the vertical files.
        Among the materials to be found are organizational charts, booklets and
        news articles. Biographical files offer articles and other clippings
        on HRA Commissioners</p>
      <p>Also of interest are reports published by predecessor agencies such
        as Department of Public Charities and Department of Welfare. <i>Annual
        Reports</i>        and other publications contain useful historical information and statistics
        from the nineteenth century to the 1960's. Explore the resources
        described here and numerous others in the rich and varied collection
        of the City Hall Library in order to learn more about the Human Resources
        Administration and the history of social services in New York City.      </p>
