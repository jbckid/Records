<p><b>
      SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK CITY REPUBLICANS</b></p>
   
    <img src="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_repmom.jpg" alt="Representative Mom" width="200" height="291" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">At the end of August, the Republican Party will hold its National Convention
    in New York City for the first time. While New York City may not be know
    as a Republican town, the GOP (Grand Old Party) has produced some politicians
    of note in both New York City and State.
    <p>The City Hall Library collection features biographies of prominent Republicans
      such as <em>Pataki</em>, the autobiography of Governor George Pataki; <em>Representative
      Mom</em> by Susan Molinari, former Congressional representative from Staten
      Island. Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani describes his philosophy of management
      and life in the best-selling <em>Leadership</em>. Did you know he also produced
      a children&#8217;s book? <em>What Will You Be?</em> is about the importance
      of setting and working towards goals. Learn more about the Lindsay years
      of Fun
      City with <em>The Ungovernable City</em> by Vincent J. Cannato. The current Mayor, Michael
      Bloomberg, has published the story of his life and success in business:
      <em>Bloomberg by Bloomberg</em>.</p>
    <p><em><img src="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_bloomberg.jpg" alt="Bloomberg by Bloomberg" width="200" height="297" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Fiorello H. LaGuardia and the Making of Modern New York by Thomas
        Kessner</em>;
        <em>Life with Fiorello</em> by Ernest Cuneo and <em>LaGuardia: A Fighter
        Against His Times 1882-1933</em> by Arthur Mann are three of the books that offer background
      on the &#8220;Little Flower.&#8221; LaGuardia was a Republican who successfully
      ran for Mayor of New York on a Fusion party ticket.</p>
    <p>Don't forget Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;TR,&quot; who eventually became
      President of the United States. H. Paul Jeffers chronicles TR's days as
      NY City Police Commissioner in <em>Commissioner Roosevelt: the Story of
      Theodore Roosevelt and the New York City Police, 1895-1897</em>. <em>Governor
      Theodore Roosevelt: The Albany Apprenticeship, 1898-1900</em>, offers an analysis of TR's years
      spent as governor of New York State. During his experience as governor,
      Roosevelt was able to formulate many of the crucial ideas and policies
      that served him well in his Presidency. <em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</em>      by Edmund Morris covers the years 1858 to 1901, exploring TR's personal
      and political histories.</p>
    <p>Consult our biographical files for articles and other sources of information
      on these and other political figures. The subject files under &#8220;Politics&#8221; offer
      articles, campaign materials and other items. Whatever your political affiliations,
      you are sure to find something of interest about the party of the elephant.<br>
