    <td>    <b>SPOTLIGHT ON:  AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE
    </b>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_equaljustice.jpg" width="265" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">February has been designated Black History Month in celebration of African-American
        culture and achievements This article will present a small sample of
        materials that are available to the user in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p>Biographical books on prominent African-Americans include <i>King of
          the Cats: the Life and Times of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.</i> by Wil Haygood.
        This biography covers the life and times of the powerful Congressman
        from Harlem with emphasis on his work for social equality for black people.
        <i>Equal Justice under Law</i> by Constance Baker Motley is the autobiography
        of the first black woman appointed to a federal judgeship. Judge Motley,
        who also served as Manhattan Borough President, tells her own life story
        within the framework of her pioneering work in the civil rights movement
        of the 1950s and 1960s. </p>
      <p>Several books deal with the African-American population and various
        issues they face as citizens of New York. <i>Caribbean New York: Black
        Immigrants and the Politics of Race</i> by Philip Kasinitz, examines the role and identity
        of the West Indian community in New York. <i>Root &amp; Branch: African-Americans
        in New York and East Jersey: 1613-1863</i> by Graham Hodges, offers a history
        of blacks during this time period in both New York City and nearby environs,
        tracing the rise of slavery, gradual emancipation and stressing the importance
        of religion and culture to the community.<img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_caribbean.jpg" width="257" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"> <i>In the Black: A History
        of African Americans on Wall Street</i> by Gregory S. Bell, tells the story
        of African-Americans, who set out to establish themselves in the securities
        and investment banking fields despite prejudice, lack of funds and many
        other barriers in the time period of 1920 to today.</p>
      <p>The <i>Mayor&#8217;s Commission on Black New Yorkers</i> was established by
        Mayor Koch in January 1986 and completed their study in November 1988.
        The Commission found that black New Yorkers tended to be less educated,
        poorer and more economically disadvantaged than whites. This report offers
        possible solutions and also contains useful statistical information on
        education, economic development, poverty and employment.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect of African-American history in New York City
        is the Harlem Renaissance. <i>When Harlem Was in Vogue</i> by David Levering
        Lewis chronicles the years from 1919 to 1935, when Harlem flourished
        as a center of art, literature and music. Writers such as Zora Neale
        Hurston, Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes achieved fame during this
        period. <i>Harlem 1900-1929: Spiritual Home of Black America </i>is a collection
        of photographs exhibited at the Schomburg Center of the New York Public
        Library in 1974. Photos include depictions of daily life as well as famous
        people and places with explanatory text.</p>
      <p>Vertical files and biographical files can also be great sources for
        additional research. There is a comprehensive, fascinating collection
        of materials on African Americans in the City Hall Library that can be
        appreciated during Black History Month or any time of year.<br>
