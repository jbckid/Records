    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: PUBLIC GARDENS</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jun2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        the opening of the first public botanical garden in 1801, botanical and
        community gardens have provided oases in the middle of the urban landscape.
        Here are some publications from the City Hall Library collection on the
        subject of gardens.</p>
      <p><i>Queens Botanical Garden Master Plan: New Facilities and Site Circulation
        Study</i> was prepared in 1992, by Peter Gisolfi Associates, landscape architects,
        for the Department of General Services. This publication outlines a plan
        for adding new buildings and enhancing the existing landscape. Included
        are an evaluation of the garden's site, objectives for the proposed
        rebuilding program and a master plan with drawings. A summary of phasing
        and costs plus statistical tables offer additional information.</p>
      <p><i>Community Open Spaces: Greening Neighborhoods through Community Action
        and Land Conservation</i> by Mark Francis, Lisa Cashdan and Lynn Paxson examines
        ten community garden projects in New York City. These community gardens
        were established in the 1970's and early 1980's. Information
        on community and government participation is given as well as background
        on funding, site design and maintenance and future plans.</p>
      <p><i>Struggle for Space: the Greening of New York City</i> was written by Tom
        Fox, Ian Koeppel and Susan Kellam of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition
        in 1985. This publication describes the work of the Coalition in creating
        community gardens in New York City neighborhoods. The history of the
        community garden movement and the formation of Neighborhood Open Space
        Coalition are chronicled. The process of building a community garden
        is considered. Recommendations for future improvements are presented.</p>
      <p>Two publications from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden are of historical
        interest. <i>Annual Reports</i> offer financial statements, photographs of the
        gardens and other information. Holdings are from 1944 to 1968. <i>Plants
        and Gardens</i> was a quarterly journal featuring articles on horticulture,
        botany and related topics. Holdings are from 1967 to 1984.</p>
