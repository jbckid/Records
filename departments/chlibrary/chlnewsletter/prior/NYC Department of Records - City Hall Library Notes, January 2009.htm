      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ISLANDS</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jan2009.jpg" width="199" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">New
        York is a city of islands. With the exception of the Bronx, the boroughs
        of New York City are located on islands. This article focuses on resources
        in the City Hall Library collection about the lesser-known islands of
        the city.</p>
      <p><i>The Other Islands of New York City: a History and Guide</i> by Sharon Seitz
        and Stuart Miller offers a wealth of information on both well-known and
        more obscure islands. Learn more about the "forgotten islands" such
        as Hoffman and Swinburne, which served as quarantine facilities for immigrants
        in the nineteenth century. Explore the natural beauty of the Jamaica
        Bay islands. This book also discusses several other islands.</p>
      <p><i>The Plan for Welfare Island: Technical Report</i> was published in 1969,
        prepared by Philip Johnson and John Burgee for New York State Urban Development
        Corp. This report details the plan for transforming this island in the
        East River into the community known today as Roosevelt Island. Included
        are analyses of land use, development of the town center and outskirts,
        transportation, recreation and other issues. Maps, architectural drawings
        and statistical tables enhance the text.</p>
      <p>City Island is an island connected to the eastern shore of the Bronx.
        In 1998, the Department of City Planning conducted the City Island Maritime
        Heritage Preservation Study. This was a segment of the New York City
        Waterfront Revitalization Program. Four studies prepared by City Planning
        describe and assess the maritime history and what needs to be done to
        preserve the heritage of the island. Current industry is discussed as
        well as future plans for growth and development. These publications are:
        <i>City Island: Maritime Heritage Preservation Study, Summary Report,
        City Island: a Maritime History, City Island's Growth</i> and <i>Development
        and City Island Maritime Industries Assessment</i>. All were published in
        2001.</p>
