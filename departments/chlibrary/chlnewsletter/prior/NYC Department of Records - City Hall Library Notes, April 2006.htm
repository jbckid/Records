      <p>
        <img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_immigrantapril1.jpg" width="195" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">In honor of Immigrant History Week, April 17 to 23, 2006, this article
          will highlight some resources that can be found in the City Hall Library
          collection. NewYork has always been known as a city of immigrants.
          Individuals and groups arriving from other parts of the world have
          contributed to the diversity and greatness of the city. Some immigrants
          made New York their new home while others arrived here first and then
          settled in other parts of the United States.  </p>
      <p><i>New People in Old Neighborhoods</i> by Louis Winnick focuses on the Brooklyn
        neighborhood, Sunset Park and how recent immigrants have contributed
        to reviving and strengthening the community. The book discusses new patterns
        in immigration, various factors that contribute to the revival of a neighborhood,
        growth and decline in Sunset Park, and future possibilities for the area.</p>
      <p><i>New Immigrants in New York</i> edited by Nancy Foner offers a collection
        of essays by various scholars and experts on the affects of new immigrants
        on New York City. The time period covered is 1965 to 1986. The first
        chapter provides a general history of immigration to New York City from
        the mid-sixties to eighties and the influence of immigrant groups on
        economic, social and political life. Other essays cover U.S. immigration
        policy and specific national groups.</p>
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_immigrantapril2.jpg" width="203" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">All the Nations under Heaven: an Ethnic and Racial History of New
          York City</i> by Frederick M. Binder and David M. Reimers chronicles the experiences
        of immigrant groups as they arrived in New York and became part of life
        here. Beginning with the days of Dutch colonization, the focus is on
        how immigrants sought to adapt to their new land while maintaining unique
        social and cultural identities. Also explored are the interactions of
        various ethnic and racial groups. The authors aim to show how the arrival
        and settlement of immigrants transformed New York life and continue to
        do so. </p>
      <p><i>Immigration in New York</i> by Elizabeth Bogen, published in 1987, studies
        how the arrival of legal immigrants in New York City between 1965 and
        1987 impacted demographics and city agency services. The main objective
        of the book is to identify the ways immigrants use city services and
        how such service providers have adapted to new immigrants to better serve
        their needs. Included are social services, public education, health care,
        criminal justice and the role of the Catholic Church. Fiscal indicators
        such as taxes, revenue and costs of services are reviewed as well as
        the growth of mass media outreach to immigrants. The author served as
        Director of the Office of Immigrant Affairs in the New York City Department
        of City Planning.</p>
      <p>City agency publications include <i>The Newest New Yorkers</i> from the Department
        of City Planning, published in a series of reports covering the 1980's
        to 2000. Statistics on places of birth of immigrants, demographic and
        economic characteristics, settlement patterns and naturalizations are
        part of these reports along with explanatory text. This publication provides
        comprehensive and helpful information for anyone researching immigration
        trends. </p>
      <p>Vertical files and biographical articles may also be of assistance in
        exploring more facets of this topic. Find out more about our predecessors
        who helped contribute to the diversity of New York City and the immigrants
        who continue that tradition.<br>
