<p><b>
      SPOTLIGHT ON: NEW YORK&#8217;S FINEST AND BRAVEST</b></p>
    <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nypd.jpg" alt="Spring 3100" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Where else but the City Hall Library can you find a copy of the 1963 comic
      book <i>Your Friend the Policeman</i>? This publication was prepared by the NYPD
      for children to help them understand the role of the police officer. There
      is a wealth of historical and current information published by the Police
      and Fire Departments, available in the Library.</p>
    <p>One of the most popular topics for research is crime statistics. The annual
      <i>Complaints and Arrests</i> reports prepared by the NYPD, contains information
      by precinct on arrests and complaints for various crimes such as burglary,
      rape, robbery, etc. These reports started in 1972. Yearly compilations
      currently end at 2001 but are supplemented by weekly reports.</p>
    <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_wnyf.jpg" alt="WNYF" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Old annual reports of the Police Department provide some assistance with
      locating crime information from years prior to 1972. Other data such as
      what units comprise the Police Department, names of officials and financial
      information can be found in these reports. The collection covers the years
      1870 to the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Both the Police and Fire Departments publish magazines. The Police Department
      magazine <i>Spring 3100</i> dates back to 1930 and the library has all issues.
      Learn about the history of the Police Department. Articles over the years
      have been about such topics as police motor vehicles, special divisions,
      profiles of officers and precincts. <i>WNYF</i> from the Fire Department offers
      a similar view. A recent issue included coverage of how the Fire Department
      dealt with the 2003 blackout. Annual reports of the Fire Department provide
      statistical and personnel information from 1855 to 2000. All of these documents
      and more offer fascinating background on New York&#8217;s Finest and Bravest.

    <p>Every month, we receive many different and unusual research questions
      at the City Hall Library, here's a sampling of recent library users and
      their
      topics:</p>

      wanted to confirm that there is a street in New York named for the actor.
      There is: E. 91 St. &#8211; James
