        of the neighborhood as if the reader is taking a walking tour. Starting
        from Christopher Street and ending up in the East Village, the author

        of notable buildings, sites and people. Learn about the Electric Circus
        disco, Grace Church, the New School and what people like Eugene O&#8217;Neill,
        Henry James and Sophie Tucker were doing in Greenwich Village.</p>

        Jackson Pollock were among those in the forefront. <i>New York&#8217;s Greenwich
