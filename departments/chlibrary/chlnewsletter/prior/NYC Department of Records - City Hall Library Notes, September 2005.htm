    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: LABOR RELATIONS</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_unionpower.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">New York City has been a center for labor activity since its earliest
        days. The City Hall Library offers a collection of materials on labor
        unions and labor relations, including books, city agency publications
        and vertical files that provide a rich assortment of resources for the
        researcher. These are just a few examples.</p>
      <p><i>Union Power &amp; New York: Victor Gotbaum and District Council 37</i> by
        Jewel Bellush and Bernard Bellush traces the history and development
        of one of the largest labor unions for New York City government employees.
        The main focus is on the growth of the union under the leadership of
        Jerry Wurf and then Victor Gotbaum. Examined are the collective bargaining
        process, political involvement, the role of DC 37 in the 1970&#8217;s
        fiscal crisis and power struggles for leadership in the Koch years.<img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_cityunion.jpg" width="194" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
      <p><i>City Unions: Managing Discontent in New York City</i> by Mark H. Maier presents
        background on the development and growth of municipal unions from the
        nineteenth century to the present. Case studies of specific unions such
        as teachers, social workers, and District Council 37 are analyzed. The
        author posits that union leadership may be responsible for many of the
        difficulties unions have encountered. </p>
      <p><i>Municipal Labor Relations in New York City: Lessons of the Lindsay-Wagner
        Years</i> by Raymond D. Horton deals with the problems faced by labor unions
        and management during the years 1954 to 1972. Included are a discussion
        of Mayor Wagner&#8217;s labor relations program, how both Mayors Wagner
        and Lindsay dealt with job actions, growth of the labor unions and suggestions
        for reforming labor relations and the collective bargaining process.</p>
      <p>Among the city agency materials are a complete collection of Labor Relations
        Orders from 1973 to the present. These are issued by the Office of Labor
        Relations. Labor contracts covering collective bargaining agreements
        between the city and various unions are available dating from the 1960&#8217;s
        to 2005. This includes contracts for District Council 37, Organization
        of Staff Analysts, Committee of Interns and Residents, Correction Officers
        and Sanitation, to name a few. Office of Collective Bargaining decisions
        from 1968 to 1994 are here, too. The Office of Collective Bargaining
        provides various means of resolving labor-related disputes between the
        city, its employees and unions.</p>
      <p>Vertical files on such topics as collective bargaining, individual labor
        unions and strikes can also be consulted for a rich variety of newspaper
        and magazine clippings. Learn more about the reasons for and effects
        of the New York City teachers strikes in 1968 and 1975, the police officers
        strike in 1971 and other job actions. Biographical files include information
        on the careers, accomplishments and backgrounds of labor leaders such
        as Albert Shanker and Victor Gotbaum. <br>
