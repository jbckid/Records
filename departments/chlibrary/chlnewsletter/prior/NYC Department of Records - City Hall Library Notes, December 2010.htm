      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: OLDER NEW YORKERS</b></p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dec2010.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">The
        New York City Department of City Planning estimates that from 2005 to
        2030, the number of New Yorkers, age 64 and older, will increase from
        922,000 to more than 1.35 million. These numbers reflect national and
        global trends. This article features some resources in the City Hall
        Library collection on the elderly.</p>
      <p><i>Promoting Positive Aging: Report on 2005-2007</i> was published by the New
        York City Department for the Aging (DFTA). This publication presents
        an overview of the accomplishments of DFTA during the two years covered. </p>
      <p>Another Department for the Aging publication is <i>Older Population
          in New York City: Mobility and Self-Care Limitations</i>. Utilizing 1990 federal
        census data, this report presents information by community district in
        each borough on the numbers of senior citizens who have limited mobility
        and need assistance in taking care of everyday personal needs. Comparisons
        are made to the population age 16 to 64. </p>
      <p><i>Age-friendly NYC: Enhancing our City's Livability for Older New
        Yorkers</i> was prepared by the Mayor's Office and City Council in
        collaboration with the New York Academy of Medicine. Through meetings,
        focus groups, seminars and review of city agency programs, key issues
        facing older New Yorkers were identified. This report presents a series
        of initiatives and recommendations for improving the quality of life
        for older New Yorkers as part of the Age-friendly NYC program. </p>
      <p>United Neighborhood Housing of New York published <i>Aging in the Shadows:
        Social Isolation among Seniors in New York City in 2005</i>. UNH studied
        various issues involving social isolation of the senior population and
        what steps could be take to provide the support needed. </p>
      <p>Other sources include vertical files plus publications from the Department
        for the Aging, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and other city
        and state agencies.</p>
