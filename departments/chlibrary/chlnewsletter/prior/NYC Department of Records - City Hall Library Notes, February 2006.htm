    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: ART AND ARTISTS IN NEW YORK CITY</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_art.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">
        New York City has been the subject of works of art as well as a mecca
          for art and artists. In the City Hall Library collection, the user
          will discover an interesting mixture of resources on art and artists.
          This article will describe just a few.</p>
      <p><i>New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970</i> by Henry Geldzahler was published
        as a companion volume to an exhibit of the same name at the Metropolitan
        Musuem of Art. Included are reproductions from the exhibition catalogue
        of works by artists like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Koonig, Jasper Johns
        and others along with explanatory essays by art critics. The focus of
        the exhibit was the New York School of artists which encompassed the
        styles of abstract expressionism, pop art and minimalism among others.</p>
      <p><i>SoHo: the Artist in the City</i> by Charles R. Simpson profiles the development
        of the South of Houston Street or SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan as an
        artistic community and center. Artists began moving into lofts in the
        1950&#8217;s. The author describes the artists&#8217; battles to preserve
        their works and living spaces, changes in the neighborhood, family life,
        redevelopment and zoning and the rising cost of real estate.</p>
      <p><i>The Art Commission and the Municipal Art Society Guide to Manhattan&#8217;s
        Outdoor Sculpture</i> by Margot Gayle and Michelle Cohen, published in 1988,
        offers information for both the visitor and resident on where to view
        and enjoy various sculptures in Manhattan. Organized by neighborhood,
        this guide gives information on the name of the work, artist, what symbols
        or figures represent, date constructed and style. </p>
      <p>A city agency publication of historical interest is <i>Catalogue of
          the Works of Art Belonging to the City of New York</i>, prepared by the Art Commission
        in 1909 and 1920. Paintings, murals and sculptures that could be found
        in various municipal buildings and facilities are photographically reproduced
        in the catalogue along with details such as creator, description, when
        presented to the city, wording on the inscription. The 1909 volumes cover
        eighteenth century to 1908, and the 1920 catalogue updates the collection
        to December 1919. Another catalogue in the collection is of the <i>First
        Municipal Art Exhibition</i>, sponsored by Mayor LaGuardia at the RCA Building
        in Rockefeller Center from February 28 to March 31, 1934. Admission to
        the exhibit was 25 cents. </p>
      <p>Vertical files on art, sculpture and statues also provide further glimpses
        into the fascinating world of art and artists. One example of what you
        may find in these files is a brochure describing twelve paintings picturing
        scenes from Washington Irving&#8217;s <i>Diedrich Knickerbocker&#8217;s
        History of New York</i>. The paintings were designed for the Jacob Ruppert
        Collection by the artist Lumen Martin Winter to commemorate the 300th
        anniversary of New York City. City Hall Library offers a unique collection
        for the researcher, artist or art lover to use and enjoy.<br>
