    <td>    <strong>SPOTLIGHT ON:    THEATRE IN NEW YORK CITY</strong>
      <p><i><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_greatwhiteway.jpg" alt="The Great White Way" width="250" height="375" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"></i>New York City has long been known as the theatre center of the world.
        From the &#8220;Great White Way&#8221;, Broadway to off-off Broadway
        and beyond to the outer boroughs, there is always a theatrical performance
        taking place in New York. The City Hall Library collection contains some
        fascinating and interesting materials on the theatre.</p>
      <p><i>The City and the Theatre: New York Playhouses from Bowling Green</i> by
        Mary C. Henderson discusses the history of theatres built in New York
        City from the Colonial days to the 1970s.<i> The Great White Way: A Re-Creation
        of Broadway&#8217;s Golden Era</i>, by Allen Churchill tells the story of
        the years 1900 to 1919, &#8220;Broadway&#8217;s golden era of theatrical
        entertainment.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Many theatres have been declared landmarks and individual reports from
        the Landmarks Preservation Commission can be accessed with details about
        history, architecture and reasons for the theatre being declared a landmark.
        Other reports of interest include the 42nd Street Development Project
        documents and <i>To Preserve the Broadway Theatre</i>, a report to the City
        Planning Commission by the Theatre Advisory Council.</p>
      <p>The Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York offers a report: <i>New York
        City&#8217;s Not-for-Profit Theatres in the Post-September 11th Era:
        Challenges and Opportunities</i>. A survey of the Alliance&#8217;s membership
        was taken to determine financial impact of 9/11 and how theatres are
        coping in the aftermath of the attacks. Recommendations for funding and
        public relations are also offered.</p>
      <p>Consult the vertical files for news clippings and other materials from
        the 1960s to the present on theatre history and current news. In the
        files on Lincoln Center, you can find a press kit given out at the opening
        of Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall) in 1962, complete with history,
        diagrams and list of opening week programs.</p>
      <p>All these and more can be discovered at the City Hall Library. Learn
        more about this vital segment of New York life and culture.
