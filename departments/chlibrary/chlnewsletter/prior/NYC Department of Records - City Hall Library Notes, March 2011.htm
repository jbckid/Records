                        <p>Since 1978, the U.S. Congress has designated March 
                          as Women&#8217;s History Month. This article focuses 
                          on two prominent women who contributed to city government. 
                          A diverse collection of resources on women who have 
                          played significant roles in New York City politics, 
                          history and culture can be explored at the City Hall 
                          Library.</p>
                        <p>Katharine Bement Davis was appointed New York City 
                          Correction Commissioner on January 1, 1914. This gave 
                          her the distinction of being the first woman to head 
                          a New York City agency. Davis had previously served 
                          as superintendent of the Bedford Hills state reformatory 
                          for women and came from a family active in the women&#8217;s 
                          suffrage movement. She ran for delegate-at-large to 
                          the New York State Constitutional Convention on the 
                          Progressive party ticket in 1914. Although she lost, 
                          Davis went on to become active in establishing the Women&#8217;s 
                          City Club to help promote women&#8217;s suffrage, improve 
                          social conditions and reform the New York City Women&#8217;s 
                          Court. After women received the right to vote in 1920, 
                          Davis was involved in establishing the League of Women 
                          Voters. Davis was born in 1860 and passed away in 1935.</p>
                        <p>Genevieve B. Earle was elected the first woman elected 
                          to the New York City Council. She served from 1938 to 
                          1949 for a total of five terms and was Republican Minority 
                          Leader. Prior to that, in 1935-1936, she was the first 
                          to serve on a New York City Charter Revision Commission. 
                          Earle was active in promoting consumer legislation, 
                          better child care programs and affordable housing. She 
                          served on a number of board and commissions including 
                          the City War Commission in 1941. Earle passed away in 
                          1956.</p>
