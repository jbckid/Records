	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_sep2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Central
        Grammar School opened in 1878 in Brooklyn. Currently known as Boys and
        Girls High School, it is the oldest high school in New York City to begin
        as a public school. High schools have played an important role in New
        York City life preparing young people for college and careers. This article
        features some resources on high schools that can be explored in the City
        Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Directory of the New York City Public High Schools: 2005-2006</i> provides
        summary descriptions of high schools, the programs offered, enrollment
        figures, graduation rates, etc. Sections on such topics as special needs
        students, program choices and selecting the appropriate school are also
        included. Individual maps for each borough pinpoint the exact location
        of the schools. Earlier editions dating back to the 1980's and
        1990's can also be found in the collection and may serve as historical
        research aids.</p>
      <p><i>Toward the 21st Century</i> is a report prepared by the Task Force on High
        School Design, appointed by the Chancellor of Schools. Published in 1971,
        this publication outlines problem areas such as outdated curricula, lack
        of equal opportunity for all students and need to utilize community resources.
        The six problem areas are analyzed in detail then possible solutions
        for short and long-term improvement are presented. </p>
      <p>The <i>Final Report</i> of the Chancellor's Working Group on High
        School Overcrowding from September 1990 details some critical issues
        concerning
        space utilization in high schools. These include administration of the
        schools, management of available space and building and leasing new space.
        Statistics on capacity are given, along with possible causes of overcrowding
        and recommendations to mitigate the situation.</p>
      <p><i>Sharing Space: Rethinking the Implementation of Small High School
          Reform in New York City</i> is a City Council report dated 2005. This publication
        explores the issues concerning establishment of "small schools." These
        schools are often part of a larger high school and designed with a small
        student enrollment in mind, primarily for youths in underprivileged neighborhoods.
        A study of thirty-four small schools and their nine host schools was
        conducted. The focus was on safety and utilization of space. Findings
        and problems are discussed along with recommendations.</p>
      <p>Other materials such as curriculum guides, periodicals and Board of
        Education <i>Annual Reports</i> may also be helpful for the researcher. Additionally,
        vertical files offer articles, other clippings, booklets, etc. on high
        schools and related topics.</p>
      <p><b>By the Way</b></p>
      <p><i>National Hispanic Heritage Month</i> is observed from September 15 to October
        15. Explore the resources of the City Hall Library such as city agency
        publications, books and clippings on the contributions of Hispanic Americans
        to New York City life, culture and history.      </p>
