    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: STATEN ISLAND</b></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_nov2006.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Staten
        Island is the southernmost borough of the five comprising New York City.
        It was named Staten Eylandt by the original Dutch settlers after the
        States General, the governing body of the Netherlands, according to the
        <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>. This article highlights some publications
        about Staten Island that are located in the City Hall Library collection.</p>
      <p><i>Memorial History of Staten Island, New York</i> by Ira K. Morris
        was originally published in 1898. This two-volume work provides a history
        of the borough
        from prehistoric times to the late nineteenth century. Included are descriptions
        of the settlement of 
        Staten Island, the borough during the American Revolution, cultural and
        social life, government, short biographies of prominent residents and
        more.</p>
      <p><i>Staten Island: Gateway to New York</i> by Dorothy Valentine Smith chronicles
        the history of Staten Island from Native American days to 1964 when the
        Verrazano Narrows Bridge was built. The author provides background on
        the historic homes, famous residents, and development of the borough
        and problems that Staten Island residents were facing in the 1960's
        such as increasing industrialization and the preservation of natural
        lands from real estate developers.</p>
      <p>Department of City Planning and City Planning Commission often publish
        studies, urban renewal plans and statistical reports relating to various
        neighborhoods and boroughs. One example is <i>Staten Island: Zoning to
        Preserve Neighborhood Character</i>. Prepared by the Commission in 1989, it summarizes
        zoning problems and proposed changes for different Staten Island neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>In the early 1990's, the possibility of Staten Island seceding
        from New York City was being considered by Staten Islanders, and borough
        and city governments. The Mayor's Task Force on Staten Island Secession
        was created to study the issues involved and report on the impact of
        secession on New York City and Staten Island. Several reports were published
        by the Task Force including: <i>Staten Island Secession: the Impact on
        City Workers</i> and <i>Staten Island Secession: the Price of Independence</i>. They
        examine such issues as budget, tax revenues, residency requirements for
        the work force, employee pensions and fringe benefits, effect of secession
        on public transportation services and more.</p>
      <p><i>2005 Staten Island Comprehensive Economic Development Policy Strategy</i>        was compiled by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation Comprehensive
        Economic Development Strategy Task Force with the assistance of the U.S.
        Economic Development Administration and U.S. Department of Housing and
        Urban Development. It details the current economic conditions in each
        Staten Island neighborhood, discusses the Task Force's objectives
        and strategies to develop and improve the economy and briefly reviews
        past strategies of the Task Force. Statistical charts and tables plus
        maps are included.</p>
      <p>Vertical files offer articles and other clippings on different Staten
        Island neighborhoods, history and population. Catch up on the latest
        borough news by browsing through the <i>Staten Island Advance</i> newspaper,
        retained for the current plus one previous month in the City Hall Library.      </p>
