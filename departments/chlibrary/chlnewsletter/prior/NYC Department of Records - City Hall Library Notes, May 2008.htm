    <td>    <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: JEWISH HERITAGE</b></p>
	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_may2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Since
        the seventeenth century, Jews have been an integral and influential part
        of New York City life. They have contributed greatly to politics, the
        arts, commerce and many other areas. In honor of Jewish American Heritage
        Month, this article focuses on some publications in the City Hall Library
        about Jewish people, culture and life.</p>
      <p><i>Herbert H. Lehman and His Era</i> by Allan Nevins is a biography of Herbert
        Lehman, Governor of New York State from 1933 to 1942. Beginning with
        Lehman's early days growing up in New York City, the book chronicles
        his career in public service. Lehman served as Lieutenant Governor of
        New York State under Franklin D. Roosevelt. When FDR chose to run for
        President, Lehman successfully campaigned for the gubernatorial office.
        Lehman's distinguished career as Governor, head of the United Nations
        Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) during World War II
        and U.S. Senator from New York State (1950-56) is presented here along
        with a personal history. Lehman was born in 1878 and died in 1963.</p>
      <p><i>Our Crowd: the Great Jewish Families of New York City</i> by Stephen Birmingham
        chronicles the rise of the great Jewish banking families of New York
        City. These include the Guggenheims, Warburgs, Goldmans and Lewisohns
        among others. The origins of these families, their rise to prominence,
        business successes and contributions to the arts and culture are examined.
        Personal letters, diaries and interviews were used as the main sources.
        Individuals such as Joseph Seligman, August Belmont, Peggy Guggenheim
        and Adolph Lewisohn are portrayed. </p>
      <p><i>Lillian Wald: Angel of Henry Street</i> by Beryl Williams profiles the reformer
        who helped establish the Henry Street Settlement House. Born in Rochester,
        New York in 1867, Wald trained as a nurse in New York City. Wald's
        experiences as a public health nurse led to her becoming active in social
        work. In addition to overseeing the Henry Street Settlement House, she
        worked for reforms in health care, education and children's services.
        She died in 1940.</p>
      <p><i>The Synagogues of New York's Lower East Side</i> features photographs
        by Jo Renee Fine and text by Gerald R. Wolfe. This is a collection of
        photos of interiors and exteriors of various synagogues. Explanatory
        text provides information on each building and historical background
        on the Jewish community of the Lower East Side.</p>
      <p>Check the biographical files for articles and other clippings on famous
        Jewish New Yorkers such as Ed Koch, Abraham Beame, Bess Myerson, Barbaralee
        Diamonstein-Spielvogel and many others. Vertical files include materials
        such as newspaper articles on related topics.<br>
