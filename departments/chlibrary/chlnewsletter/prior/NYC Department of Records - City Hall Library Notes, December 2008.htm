      <p><b>SPOTLIGHT ON: CHURCHES</b> </p>      
      <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_dec2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">The
        first Christian congregation in New York City was established by the
        Dutch Reformed Church in 1628. In 1654, Sephardic Jews from Brazil formed
        the first Jewish congregation in America. The year 1893 saw the opening
        of the first Islamic mission in the city. This article highlights some
        resources in the City Hall Library on churches, synagogues and other
        places of worship.</p>
      <p><i>Neighborhood Revitalization and Religious Institutions</i> was prepared
        by the New York City Department of City Planning and the Cheswick Center
        in 1979. This report summarizes discussions held at a workshop in 1978,
        attended by clergy, community leaders and city officials. Using the example
        of Flatbush in Brooklyn, the role of religious institutions in improving
        the community is considered.</p>
      <p><i>Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue</i> by J. Robert Wright chronicles the
        history of the famous Episcopalian church in midtown Manhattan. Beginning
        with its founding in 1823, the author tells the history of the church,
        its buildings and its people. Included are background on the rectors
        of the church, the exterior and interior designs, the musical traditions
        of St. Thomas and relocation from downtown to midtown. Numerous historical
        and current photos and drawings enhance the text.</p>
      <p><i>The Synagogues of New York's Lower East Side</i> features photographs
        by Jo Renee Fine and text by Gerald R. Wolfe. This is a collection of
        photos of interiors and exteriors of various synagogues. Explanatory
        text provides information on each building and historical background
        on the Jewish community of the Lower East Side.</p>
      <p>Many churches and synagogues have been declared landmark buildings.
        The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has published <i>Designation
        Reports</i> for each of these. Also of interest is the nine-volume <i>Inventory
        of the Church Archives of New York City</i>, a Works Projects Administration
        (WPA) survey published in 1939. This is a compilation of the holdings
        of archives of Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches,
        seminaries and other institutions. </p>

       <p><b>New
             York Rises: Photographs by Eugene de Salignac</b> </p>
       <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newyorkrises.jpg" border="1" align="left">The Municipal
           Archives' new book, "New York Rises: The Photographs by Eugene de
           Salignac" is a fascinating history of the City in never-before-seen
           images taken over the first four decades of the twentieth century.</p>
       <p>In recognition
           of the revised second printing of New York Rises (available in bookstores
           November 28th), the Municipal Archives is making this special offer:
           Purchase $80 or more in print sales from the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/about/archives.shtml">The
           New York City Municipal Archives' Photo Gallery</a> from
           now until December 15th and receive a free 8x10 inch archival digital
           print of Eugene de Salignac's famous photograph "Brooklyn Bridge showing
           painters on suspenders, October 7, 1914"</p>
       <p>From 1906
           to 1934, Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer of the Department
           of Bridges, traveled around the five boroughs documenting all manner
           of construction projects designed to knit together the newly consolidated
           Greater City of New York. The result was 20,000 large-format glass-plate
           negatives that are now preserved in the Municipal Archives. More than
           just a proficient technician, de Salignac's mastery puts him on par
           with some of the greatest photographers of his era. The book includes
           96 of the best pictures, printed as duotone images in a hardcover
           edition with an essay by noted historian Kevin Moore, and commentary
           by Municipal Archives photography curator, Michael Lorenzini. </p>
