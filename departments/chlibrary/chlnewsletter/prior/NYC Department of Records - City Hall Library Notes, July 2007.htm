	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_july2007.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Home
        of the Cyclone, Steeplechase Park and the Nathan's hot dog, Coney
        Island in Brooklyn has been a seaside attraction since the late nineteenth
        century. In honor of another summer at the beach and the seventieth anniversary
        of the Cyclone roller coaster, this article will feature publications
        devoted to the subject of Coney Island.</p>
      <p><i>The Improvement of Coney Island, Rockaway and South Beaches</i> was published
        in 1939 by the Department of Parks. This report discusses problems with
        these beach areas and what actions can be taken to improve conditions.
        Issues such as overcrowded beaches, inadequate sanitary facilities and
        limited public transportation access are considered.</p>
      <p><i>Good Old Coney Island: a Sentimental Journey into the Past</i> by Edo McCullough
        was originally published in 1957. This is a chronicle of the attractions
        and distractions of Coney Island, written by someone whose family developed
        the area as a beachfront resort. Here are the stories of Steeplechase
        and Luna Park, the carnival sideshows, the food and the personalities
        that made Coney Island unique.</p>
      <p><i>Sodom by the Sea: an Affectionate History of Coney Island</i> by Oliver
        Pilat and Jo Ranson has a publication date of 1941. The time period covered
        is from the Dutch settlement until early 1941. This book chronicles the
        early settlement of the area, political leadership, stories of amusement
        parks and side shows, food concessions and more.</p>
      <p>Consult <i>Landmark Designation Reports</i> prepared by the Landmarks Preservation
        Commission for information on the Cyclone, Parachute Jump and other landmarks
        at Coney Island. Also, explore the neighborhood files to learn more about
        the Coney Island area and surrounding communities.<br>
