      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_arcadia.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">The
        largest borough in land area, about 120 square miles, according to the
        <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i>, Queens is home to many varied neighborhoods
        from Long Island City to New Hyde Park. The population of Queens is known
        for its diversity. According to the 2002 <i>Annual Report on Social Indicators</i>        from the Dept. of City Planning, Queens added over 321,000 foreign-born
        persons in the last decade. Its total foreign-born population surpassed
        one million in 2000, making Queens the most diverse borough in population,
        according to City Planning&#8217;s report. The City Hall Library collection
        offers a number of resources about the borough, its neighborhoods and
        the fascinating mix of populations living there.</p>
      
     

      <p><i>Queens: A Pictorial History</i> by Vincent Seyfreid explores the history
        of Queens from the 16th century to the 1980&#8217;s. Original photos
        and drawings are accompanied by text, covering such topics as settlement,
        transportation, leisure and profiles of selected neighborhoods. Among
        the neighborhoods are Flushing, Jamaica, Woodside and College Point. </p>
      <p><i>A Modern Arcadia: Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and the Plan for Forest
        Hills Gardens</i> by Susan L. Klaus, offers a history of one of the first
        middle-class suburban communities within the New York City limits. Conceived
        and planned in 1909, Forest Hills Gardens still exists today. This book
        discusses the construction, planning, architectural design and enduring
        legacy of the community.<img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_queens.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
      <p><i>The Story of Queens Village</i>, also by Vincent F. Seyfried, published
        in 1974 to celebrate the centennial of the neighborhood, is a history
        of Queens Village starting with it s establishment in colonial times.
        Included are the growth of Queens Village in the nineteenth century,
        histories of the Bellaire and Creedmoor sections, the story of the Snyder-Gray
        murder case, which brought notoriety to Queens Village, transportation,
        churches of Queens Village and descriptions of some well-known institutions
        such as Martin Van Buren High School and Antun&#8217;s restaurant. Historical
        photos and drawings enhance the text.</p>
      <p>The City Planning Dept. has prepared various zoning and redevelopment
        reports for different areas of Queens over the years. <i>Community District
        Needs</i> from Office of Management and Budget is another useful source to
        consult for statistical information and current conditions and needs
        in neighborhood community district. There is one volume for each borough.</p>
      <p>Vertical files are a great source for newspaper and magazine articles
        on Queens in general and specific neighborhoods. You can learn about
        the history, population, housing, business and many other aspects of
        Queens life. Any of these materials and more can provide a fascinating
        view of the borough closest to Long Island.<br>
