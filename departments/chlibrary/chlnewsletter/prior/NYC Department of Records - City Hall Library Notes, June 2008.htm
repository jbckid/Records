	  <p><i>By Christine Bruzzese</i></p>
      <p><img src="http://nyc.gov/html/records/images/newsletter_jun2008.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">From
        McDonald's to the Four Seasons, New York City is filled with restaurants
        to suit all tastes. This article features some resources in the City
        Hall Library collection on the topic of restaurants. </p>
      <p><i>Delmonico's: a Century of Splendor</i> by Lately Thomas was published
        in 1967. This book tells the story of the cafe and pastry shop
        that became the most famous restaurant in New York City in the nineteenth
        and early twentieth centuries. Included are details on the founding of
        Delmonico's, growth in popularity, stories of famous diners, and
        how Delmonico's brought about changes in American cuisine and eating
        habits. Delmonico's closed in 1923. </p>
      <p><i>New York City Restaurant Guide</i> was prepared by the Department of Consumer
        Affairs in 1996. This guide provides advice to the prospective restaurant
        owner on construction, proper equipment and appliances, health issues
        and more. </p>
      <p><i>Where to Dine in Thirty-Nine</i> by Diana Ashley is a guide to various restaurants
        in New York City, published in 1939. Listings are organized by type of
        cuisine. Learn what were considered the best Chinese, Italian, German
        and other restaurants. Selected recipes and price information are included.
        Incidentally, luncheon at Jack Dempsey's restaurant was priced
        at 75 cents and up, dinner from $1.50 up.</p>
      <p><i>Dining out, Dining Healthy: the Link between Public Health and Working
        Conditions in New York City's Restaurant Industry</i> was published
        in 2006 by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York and the New
        York City Restaurant Coalition. This report is based on a survey of 880
        restaurant workers in the city. Labor law violations committed by restaurant
        owners and the adverse effects on workers and business are examined.
        Comparisons are made with eating establishments where laws and regulations
        are followed.</p>
      <p>Several buildings that currently or formerly house restaurants have
        been declared landmarks by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Look
        for these reports in the City Hall Library collection as well as clippings
        on restaurants and related topics in the vertical files.<br>
